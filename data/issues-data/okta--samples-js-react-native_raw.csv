I'm having an issue getting this example to work properly. Upon entering the correct login information, the app throws a error with code -600 (Okta Oidc Error). Looking at the admin logs shows that okta believes a successful login occurred. I have reached the same issue working with both browser sign in and custom sign in. I am using an Android device running Android 10. I read posts in the developer forums that mentioned building a new virtual device solved the problem, but the same error has been thrown on my physical device, and three different virtual devices. 
Has anyone run into this issue and resolved it? It seems very odd that okta reads the interaction as a success, but library receives an error. ",0,0,0,9

okta/samples-js-react-native,48,Android browser not opening in release build when minifying code,"When we build the application for release, the browser does not open when we call `signIn`. After doing a lot of digging, it appears to be caused by setting `minifyEnabled` to be true inside the `app build.gradle`'s release build type:

```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(""proguard-android.txt""), ""proguard-rules.pro""
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
    }
}
```

Simply changing `minifyEnabled` to `false` is a work around, but we'd like to continue minimizing the native code.

This isn't necessarily limited to release builds, it could happen on debug as well if `minifyEnabled` is `true`

When I attempt to run the application, on all device configurations I tested, I see the Login button, but tapping it does not bring up the Okta browser login page. Adding some logging statements, the call to `@okta okta-react-native`'s `signIn()` function returns a promise that resolves quickly (no arguments passed to the resolve handler).

This behavior happens on the following configurations I tested:
- Emulator: Pixel C API 28 (Android 9.0, x86)
