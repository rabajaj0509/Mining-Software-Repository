oceanprotocol/contracts,365,FixedExchangeRate creates an unnecessary token,"At RPI, we're trying to publish our API on the Ocean Marketplace.

In the past, we asked ourselves if e.g. we could publish an asset with a token and a price discovery pool but our lawyers in Germany came back and told us that this would involve incorporating in a token-friendly jurisdiction and lots of other jazz. Since the gain of using dynamic price discovery seemed negligible given the number of API users, we scrapped the whole idea for a while and decide to sit out the problem.

But then this week, we thought that we could maybe just use the FixedExchangeRate asset. Our mental model was that it'd entail deploying a smart contract that simply took OCEANs in exchange for API usage.

But going through the publishing steps now, it's become clear that indeed there too, an actual token is launched: 

- https:  market.oceanprotocol.com asset did:op:eb651bF2FFaE34E859431Eeba8ff6c686A4EcE55
- https:  rinkeby.etherscan.io token 0xeb651bF2FFaE34E859431Eeba8ff6c686A4EcE55

The problem with launching a token is regulatory uncertainty but in this case also the non-necessity. Conceptually, what we need to launch our API without talking to 3 lawyers in 4 countries is a contract that can take OCEAN in and then allows the sender to access a URI on the provider API based on the respective on-chain event. It's fairly simple from a technical perspective I believe.

It'd be important that there are explicitly no tokens used or deployed. E.g if we had deployed a FixedExchangeRate token on the Ethereum mainnet that'd allow transferring, wouldn't it allow anyone to create a dynamically priced pool and hence make us the emitters of a security?

We'd like to ensure that this won't happen, so we find deploying a token for a FixedExchangeRate unnecesary.",0,0,0,1

Workaround is to use dapptool's `DAPP_REMAPPINGS`. It's because oceanprotocol contracts doesn't expose their contracts through the recommended dapptools `lib` folder

remappings.txt

```txt
ds-test =lib ds-test src 
ds-test=lib ds-test src test.sol
oceanprotocol-contracts=lib oceanprotocol-contracts contracts

(Note that I renamed from ""contracts"" to ""oceanprotocol-contracts"".

Anyways, this still won't work because I guess openzepellin dependencies are injected by the tool that ocean repo is using.",0,0,0,1

oceanprotocol/contracts,358,V4: Batch buys ,"If you need to buy multiple DT (let's say for a compute job which has multiple datasets), you have to send one transaction for each DT that you want to buy.

We could have a buyDTBatch function in FactoryRouter, that needs the following parameters:
 
- uint type[]  (fixedrate,dispenser,pool)
-  address source[] (fixed rate address , dispenser address, pool address) - depends on type (if fixed rate or dispenser, address can be 0, we can fill it from Factory)
 - bytes32[]  (can be either fixed rate exchangeID, or swapExactAmountOut   swapExactAmountIn for pools)
 - address[] - (only for pools, it's tokenIn)
- uint256[] - (only for pools, it's maxAmountIn (for swapExactAmountOut)   tokenAmountIn)
 - address[] - (only for pools, it's tokenOut)
- uint256[] - (fixed rate it's dataTokenAmount,  for pools, it's tokenAmountOut(for swapExactAmountOut)   minAmountOut)
- uint256[] - (only for pools, it's maxPrice)

Obviously, the consumer needs to approve the FactoryRouter address as spender of the required input tokens.

Perks:
 - one single call to buy multiple DT for multiple assets  (better UX, better gas optimization)
 - built-in support for DT 1 -> DT2 swaps  in one call (using intermediary base tokens. IE:   DT1 -> Ocean, Ocean -> DT2) (better UX, better gas optimization)

oceanprotocol/contracts,357,V4:  V3 Datatoken support,"Since now we have a full plan to migrate from V3 to V4, I think we should ditch the v3->v4 migrate path in the smartcontracts.

Tech wise, it's going to be a nightmare, because even if you migrate a V3 DT to a V4 ERC721 + V3 DT scenario,   V3 DT is not supported in the libs (because of new fee structure, different function args, etc), so you need:
 - a way of embeeding V3 DT abis in the v4 smartcontracts
- a way of detecting DT version
- how to handle startOrder depending on the version
- how to handle minting options

oceanprotocol/contracts,342,V4: Multiple orders in the same transaction," When dealing with so many ERC20 addresses, different consumeFeeTokens and publishMarketFeeTokens it's going to be difficult to have a good UX (for each consumption, you need a couple of approvals for fee tokens, etc).
 Also, if you need to order multiple datasets (think about a C2d Job with one algo and 10 datasets), you will end up with a lot of transactions

Proposal:
 Have a startMultipleTokenOrder function in our Factory.
 Pros: 
- as a user  you can have an infinite approval for all feeTokens
- as a user when ordering multiple services, you only have 1 transactions (and some approvals first, depending on feeTokens)

 This function can use payer consumer parameters in startOrder, so no issues here. 
 Also, provenance is kept on the blockchain level.

oceanprotocol/contracts,340,Use of templates,"Since we are planning for multiple templates, we should not constrain ourselfefs and others to use a fixed, typed parameter during initialize.


Example of ERC20Template initialize:
```
 function initialize(
        string calldata name_,
        string calldata symbol_,
        address erc721Address,
        uint256 cap_,
        address communityFeeCollector,
        address minter,
        address router_,
        address feeManager
```

what if my ERC20Template needs other stuff ?  Bonding curves parameters, etc..

Proposal:
  Templates should accept a bunch of arrays, so users can pass their custom parameters.
Example:
````
 **
     * @dev _initialize
     *      Private function called on contract initialization.

     *                     [1]  = feeManager initial feeManager for this DT
     *                     [2]  = publishing Market Address

     *                     [1]  = communityFeeCollector it is the community fee collector address
     *                     [2]  = router address
     *
     * @param uints_  refers to an array of uints
     *                     [0] = cap_ the total ERC20 cap
     *                     [1] = publishing Market Fee Amount

## PublishMarketFees:
- publishFeeAddress
- publishFeeToken,
- publishFeeAmount 

Functions in ERC20 template:
 - initialize takes extra arguments to create the fee structure
 - updateFeeParams (only publishFeeAddress)
 - getFeeParams (so the market can display them)
 




## ConsumeMarketFee
- consumeFeeAddress,
- consumeFeeToken,
- consumeFeeAmount  - 
 
Set in startOrder function as parameters by the consumeMarket - OPF takes a cut (1%)


## startOrder fetches fees & DT from consumer wallet and transfers them to : 

- publishMarket
- consumeMarket
- OPF (1% from publishFee + 1% from consumeFee)
- publisher (1 DT)



## SwapFees
- pool swap  -  OPF (0.1%, + 0.1% if base token not (OCEAN, stable OCEAN, etc)
- fixed price swap  -  OPF (0.1%, + 0.1% if base token not (OCEAN, stable OCEAN, etc)

oceanprotocol/contracts,323,Deploy Ocean to Aurora Testnet (NEAR),"## TODOs
- [ ] Ensure there's a way to get OCEAN bridged over
- [ ] Multisig for OPF Wallet
- [ ] Deploy Ocean Smart Contracts
- [ ] Update ocean.js
- [ ] Deploy provider
- [ ] Add aquarius indexer
- [ ] Update graph
- [ ] Update market
- [ ] Update docs.oceanprotocol.com ""supported networks""

## Motivation

Aurora is an Ethereum Virtual Machine created by the stellar team at the NEAR Protocol, delivering a turn-key solution for developers to operate their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable and future-safe platform, with low transaction costs for their users. For more information, please refer to [Aurora docs](https:  doc.aurora.dev develop networks)

## Advantages
- **Uses ETH** as a base currency
- Totally **Permissionless Bridge**
- **Bridging ERC20 tokens will come up soon**

![image](https:  user-images.githubusercontent.com 5428661 121009765-d6eee600-c794-11eb-99f3-384f952516dd.png)

## Faucet

- You can bridge any amount of [Ropsten ETH](https:  faucet.ropsten.be ) to Aurora testnet through [Aurora bridge](https:  testnet.aurora.dev bridge). Just connect your Metamask with Ropsten and then you can bridge your tokens to the same address on Aurora. It takes around 2~4 mins to bridge the tokens as it waits for the transaction finality. Finally check out the The Aurora testnet metamask configuration below (Please make sure to use `ETH` as a **currency symbol**).

- Or you can use the Faucet but still doesn't have lots of liquidity [here](https:  faucet.testnet.aurora.dev )

oceanprotocol/contracts,307,Thoughts about increasing liquidity through swap routing and vaults.,"Balancer, Uniswap both introduce a ""router"" contract above all AMM to improve liquidity between assets [1, 2]. For Uniswap V1 & V2 (don't know about V3) and balancer V1, the conceptual model is: 1 AMM contains an asset pair that can be traded. However, there are intersections between AMMs. Consider the following example:

AMM 1:
- ETH
- DAI

AMM 2:
- ETH
- USDC

Now, if there was no router, to go from say DAI to USDC, I had to do two transactions:

- Sell DAI to ETH DAI pool to receive ETH
- Sell ETH to ETH USDC pool to receive USDC

It'd mean I'd have to pay twice the amount of gas, sign two transactions and the process would take the double amount of time.

To optimize this, both Balancer and Uniswap have introduced a ""router"" contract that can execute trades between intersecting AMMs. A user can call the router and say: ""Please swap DAI => USDC through ETH DAI and ETH USDC"".

A router comes with the following benefits:

- Routers improve price discovery as price reflects the actual value better since there are left less to arbitrageurs [1].
- A user's gas costs are lower
- The steps of inter-trading OCEAN assets decreases
- It's easier for the user to understand that they can to trade QUIRCA-0 TREMPEL-36

To improve overall swap liquidity further, it'd be great if the router was compatible with e.g. ETH OCEAN AMM that are not directly controlled by OPF too. E.g. the OCEAN BNT pool currently holds $26M in liquidity [3]. ETH OCEAN holds $7M at a volume of $1,8M just in the last 24hrs. 

It'd give all data tokens a tremendous boost if these liquidity pools would connect e.g. with the data token pools.

Finally, another option to improve cross-asset liquidity is upgrading to Balancer V2, which is planned for Q2 2021 [5]. From my understanding V2 stores all tokens in a vault to optimize gas costs too. Essentially it addresses the same problem as the router. However, I leave the following question in this thread:

From my understanding, all AMM platform providers currently optimize gas costs for assets within their AMM network. As we can see from the situation today, however, liquidity is spread evenly through these providers. For data tokens to receive the best liquidity bridge possible, is there an additional option that provides interoperability and captures the maximum amount of liquidity across all AMM provider platforms (e.g. Uniswap, Sushiswap, Bancor, Balancer etc.).

- can be activated for a specific Datatoken
- can call datatoken's approveMinter (if owner requires that)
- can hold a balance of datatokens (since it will receive DT from consume or owner can send tokens to this contract)
- will dispense a maximum amount of X DT to requesting users, if their balance is < Y DT  (X,Y configurable on datatoken activation).  If balance is not enough, it should mint more tokens (if we are the new minter)
- can be activated deactivated (stores the status for a specific datatoken, along with the original minter) only by the original minter
- will have a status function (given DT address, returns balance, isMinter, owner, active)
- will emit events for:  activate deactivate, dispense

oceanprotocol/contracts,294,Implement EIP-2612 in all datatokens,"Last week, 9,4% of token transactions on Ethereum were `Approval` transactions [1]. `Approval` transactions in ERC-20 tokens are made to e.g. allow a third-party contract to withdraw tokens from an ERC-20 token. E.g. when a user does a swap on the Ocean Market, most of the time an `Approval` transaction is required.

However, `Approval` transactions' on-chain execution is wasteful and in many cases unnecessary. [ERC-2612 ](https:  eips.ethereum.org EIPS eip-2612) addresses this problem by allowing to approve messages that are broadcast and signed offline using [ERC-712](https:  eips.ethereum.org EIPS eip-712). ERC-2612 adds a function to the ERC-20 interface and is hence NOT a breaking change. There are implementations running in production [2].

For the Ocean Market interface there's an additional benefit that too applies for L2:

- Any user interface flow that requires an upfront approval transaction from a user means the user has to do at least two on-chain interactions with Metamask. Generally, more means worse. Don't make me think. But there's also specific reasons like:
  - The user may become insecure confused about the approval transactions and hence cancel the process
  - The user may become impatient

For all new data tokens that are launched on the Ocean market. Please consider adding EIP-2612, thanks.

oceanprotocol/contracts,290,Reconcile unit tests in ocean.js & contracts,"**Background   motivation**

This is pre-V4 refactoring work.

Both `contracts` and `ocean.js` repo have a lot of JS-based tests. This hurts maintainability: where do you test? Right now it's unclear what the division is, and there's almost certainly a lot of redundancy. This violates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, which we strive to follow.

Furthermore, @lacoop6tu mentioned: 
- ""have been looking at the tests in contracts and most of them are actually already in the Ocean.js, (some of those tests I added them personally while increasing code coverage weeks ago). I will go test by test to see what is tested in the contracts and not in Ocean.js)""

**Scope of issue**

By the time this issue is done:
- There should be _no_ tests in `contracts` repo. (Because each given tests will have been moved to ocean.js   modified, or deprecated).
- Documentation in `contracts` repo should instruct user on tests using ocean.js
- Ideally, CI for `contracts` repo uses ocean.js too (not sure how feasible)

oceanprotocol/contracts,276,"Can't complete release process. Fails at (1) ""npm run doc:generate"" step (2) websockets dependency   yarn vs npm, (3) more?","**Describe the bug**
I'm trying to do a new release of contracts, because I've improved the README. (And I want to practice before fixing [multi-repo#83](https:  github.com oceanprotocol multi-repo-issue issues 83)).

So I'm going through the steps, and it fails at the `npm run doc:generate` step. Wrong compiler version for `solc` or `solidity-docgen`.

And even if I simply skip that, then it fails later on in a websockets dependency.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the docgen failure:
1. Go through the steps of the main README, up to the ""Releases"" section
2. In the ""Releases"" section, skip the first step ""Submit contributions with this workflow."" Not needed here, it's an overview.
3. In the ""Releases"" section, go to second step, the [README for release process](https:  github.com oceanprotocol contracts blob master docs RELEASE_PROCESS.md)
4. Go through each step of that README for release process
5. It will fail at the `npm run doc:generate` step. 

Steps to reproduce the websockets dependency failure:
1. Just keep following release process README, and it will fail in the yarn (yarn install) step, complaining about a missing websockets dependency. Note: on travis, it would fail; and I could get it to fail locally in the same way too. I went to try to fix it, but I quickly got tangled up in npm vs yarn and having package.json, package-lock.json, more. (Seems complicated.)

**Expected behavior**

This issue will be considered complete when:
- [ ] It doesn't fail at the issues reported above, and
- [ ] Release process docs have been updated, and other things fixed as needed, so that one can release successfully.

**Additional context**

Versions: 
* ubuntu 18.04
* npm 7.6.3
* node 14.16.0
* solidity-docgen 7.6.3
* solc 7.6.3

Balancer is currently the leading contender to make marketplace non-custodial and to support marketplace incentives. I encountered this issue first hand this week while doing Balancer experiments (I did a workaround in my branch by fudging the file to 18 decimals). Details of why are in [this V3 slide](https:  docs.google.com presentation d 1YlzLOgVAJ1vbRak4HorQ4y7vQ2EI5hKGnP-UMWYQzfk edit?ts=5e58d4b7#slide=id.g86053b9075_0_39).

I recommend 18 decimals because that's what ETH and OCEAN have (as most other tokens). It allows library conversion commands fromWei() and toWei().

<blockquote>
<h2>OpenZeppelin Contracts 3.0.1< h2>
<p>This is a small bugfix release, addressing an issue that allowed for some <code>internal< code> functions in ERC777 to be called with the zero address as one of their arguments.< p>
<p>This was reported in <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts issues 2208"">OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts#2208< a>, fixed in <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts pull 2212"">OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts#2212< a> for the v2.5 branch, and ported to the v3.0 branch in <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts pull 2213"">OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts#2213< a>.< p>
<h2>OpenZeppelin Contracts 3.0< h2>
<p>We're thrilled to finally announce the <strong>release of OpenZeppelin Contracts v3.0< strong> :sparkles:< p>
<p>Among other things, this release features the <strong>migration to Solidity v0.6< strong>, as well as a <strong>revamped access control system< strong>, <strong>streamlined token contracts< strong>, and new libraries for <strong>enumerable mappings< strong>.< p>
<p>To install this latest release, run:< p>
<pre lang=""bash""><code>npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin contracts
< code>< pre>
<h2>What's New< h2>
<ul>
<li>All contracts were migrated to Solidity v0.6.< li>
<li><code>AccessControl< code> was designed <a href=""https:  forum.openzeppelin.com t redesigning-accesscontrol-for-the-openzeppelin-contracts 2177"">with help from the community< a> and has replaced <code>Roles< code> contracts (such as <code>MinterRole< code> and <code>PauserRole< code>), which were removed.< li>
<li>Crowdsales were removed: we'll continue to provide support for security issues on the v2.5 release, but will not bring them over to v3.0.< li>
<li>We've added <strong>hooks< strong>, a new feature of the library that will make extending it easier than ever.< li>
<li><code>ERC20< code> and <code>ERC721< code> were simplified and streamlined, including all optional parts of the standard by default, and simplifying some of our own custom extensions.< li>
<li>Support for better <code>mapping< code> types that let you efficiently iterate over all keys using <code>EnumerableSet< code> and <code>EnumerableMap< code>< li>
<li>Many, <em>many< em> breaking changes with small improvements. We've also moved some contracts around (e.g. <code>Ownable< code> is now found under the <code>access< code> directory) and deleted some that were not being used. Head to our <a href=""https:  github.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts blob master CHANGELOG.md"">changelog< a> to see the full list.< li>
< ul>
<h2>Compiling v0.6 Contracts< h2>
<p>You can use the <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com cli""><strong>OpenZeppelin CLI< strong>< a> to compile any Solidity v0.6 contract: just update the <code>pragma< code> statement on your source code and you'll be good to go!< p>
<pre lang=""solidity""><code>pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
< code>< pre>
<p>Note that you will need to use the <a href=""https:  forum.openzeppelin.com t openzeppelin-cli-2-7 2252"">v2.7 release of the CLI< a> or newer to have Solidity v0.6 support. For detailed information about using the CLI compiler, head to its <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com cli compiling"">documenation< a>.< p>
<h2>Revamped Access Control< h2>
<p>One of our most widely-used contracts is <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com contracts 3.x api access#Ownable""><code>Ownable< code>< a>, providing a simple authorization scheme. However, this fell short in complex systems with <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts issues 366"">multiple permissions< a>.< p>
<p>The v3.0 release introduces <code>AccessControl< code>, a one-stop-shop for all authorization needs. It lets you easily define multiple <strong>roles with different permissions< strong>, as well as <strong>which accounts are allowed to grant and revoke< strong> each role. It also boosts transparency by enabling <strong>enumeration of all privileged accounts< strong> in a system.< p>
<p><code>AccessControl< code> was designed with a security-first mindset, <a href=""https:  forum.openzeppelin.com t redesigning-accesscontrol-for-the-openzeppelin-contracts 2177"">receiving input from a wide array of users< a> and incorporating best practices in the field. Head to <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com contracts 3.x access-control#role-based-access-control"">our Access Control guide< a> for more information!< p>
<h2>Preset Contracts< h2>
<p>OpenZeppelin Contracts shine when you need the building blocks to get to the right feature set, but that's not all they can do! We've added a new family of <strong>Preset< strong> contracts starting with ERC20 and ERC721 tokens that you can quickly deploy as-is <strong>without having to write any Solidity code< strong>. Check out <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com contracts 3.x api presets"">their documentation!< a>< p>

<blockquote>
<h2>OpenZeppelin Contracts 3.0.1< h2>
<p>This is a small bugfix release, addressing an issue that allowed for some <code>internal< code> functions in ERC777 to be called with the zero address as one of their arguments.< p>
<p>This was reported in <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts issues 2208"">OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts#2208< a>, fixed in <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts pull 2212"">OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts#2212< a> for the v2.5 branch, and ported to the v3.0 branch in <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts pull 2213"">OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts#2213< a>.< p>
<h2>OpenZeppelin Contracts 3.0< h2>
<p>We're thrilled to finally announce the <strong>release of OpenZeppelin Contracts v3.0< strong> :sparkles:< p>
<p>Among other things, this release features the <strong>migration to Solidity v0.6< strong>, as well as a <strong>revamped access control system< strong>, <strong>streamlined token contracts< strong>, and new libraries for <strong>enumerable mappings< strong>.< p>
<p>To install this latest release, run:< p>
<pre lang=""bash""><code>npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin contracts
< code>< pre>
<h2>What's New< h2>
<ul>
<li>All contracts were migrated to Solidity v0.6.< li>
<li><code>AccessControl< code> was designed <a href=""https:  forum.openzeppelin.com t redesigning-accesscontrol-for-the-openzeppelin-contracts 2177"">with help from the community< a> and has replaced <code>Roles< code> contracts (such as <code>MinterRole< code> and <code>PauserRole< code>), which were removed.< li>
<li>Crowdsales were removed: we'll continue to provide support for security issues on the v2.5 release, but will not bring them over to v3.0.< li>
<li>We've added <strong>hooks< strong>, a new feature of the library that will make extending it easier than ever.< li>
<li><code>ERC20< code> and <code>ERC721< code> were simplified and streamlined, including all optional parts of the standard by default, and simplifying some of our own custom extensions.< li>
<li>Support for better <code>mapping< code> types that let you efficiently iterate over all keys using <code>EnumerableSet< code> and <code>EnumerableMap< code>< li>
<li>Many, <em>many< em> breaking changes with small improvements. We've also moved some contracts around (e.g. <code>Ownable< code> is now found under the <code>access< code> directory) and deleted some that were not being used. Head to our <a href=""https:  github.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts blob master CHANGELOG.md"">changelog< a> to see the full list.< li>
< ul>
<h2>Compiling v0.6 Contracts< h2>
<p>You can use the <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com cli""><strong>OpenZeppelin CLI< strong>< a> to compile any Solidity v0.6 contract: just update the <code>pragma< code> statement on your source code and you'll be good to go!< p>
<pre lang=""solidity""><code>pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
< code>< pre>
<p>Note that you will need to use the <a href=""https:  forum.openzeppelin.com t openzeppelin-cli-2-7 2252"">v2.7 release of the CLI< a> or newer to have Solidity v0.6 support. For detailed information about using the CLI compiler, head to its <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com cli compiling"">documenation< a>.< p>
<h2>Revamped Access Control< h2>
<p>One of our most widely-used contracts is <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com contracts 3.x api access#Ownable""><code>Ownable< code>< a>, providing a simple authorization scheme. However, this fell short in complex systems with <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts issues 366"">multiple permissions< a>.< p>
<p>The v3.0 release introduces <code>AccessControl< code>, a one-stop-shop for all authorization needs. It lets you easily define multiple <strong>roles with different permissions< strong>, as well as <strong>which accounts are allowed to grant and revoke< strong> each role. It also boosts transparency by enabling <strong>enumeration of all privileged accounts< strong> in a system.< p>
<p><code>AccessControl< code> was designed with a security-first mindset, <a href=""https:  forum.openzeppelin.com t redesigning-accesscontrol-for-the-openzeppelin-contracts 2177"">receiving input from a wide array of users< a> and incorporating best practices in the field. Head to <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com contracts 3.x access-control#role-based-access-control"">our Access Control guide< a> for more information!< p>
<h2>Preset Contracts< h2>
<p>OpenZeppelin Contracts shine when you need the building blocks to get to the right feature set, but that's not all they can do! We've added a new family of <strong>Preset< strong> contracts starting with ERC20 and ERC721 tokens that you can quickly deploy as-is <strong>without having to write any Solidity code< strong>. Check out <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com contracts 3.x api presets"">their documentation!< a>< p>

<h2>OpenZeppelin Contracts 3.0.1< h2>
<p>This is a small bugfix release, addressing an issue that allowed for some <code>internal< code> functions in ERC777 to be called with the zero address as one of their arguments.< p>
<p>This was reported in <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts issues 2208"">OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts#2208< a>, fixed in <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts pull 2212"">OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts#2212< a> for the v2.5 branch, and ported to the v3.0 branch in <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts pull 2213"">OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts#2213< a>.< p>
<h2>OpenZeppelin Contracts 3.0< h2>
<p>We're thrilled to finally announce the <strong>release of OpenZeppelin Contracts v3.0< strong> :sparkles:< p>
<p>Among other things, this release features the <strong>migration to Solidity v0.6< strong>, as well as a <strong>revamped access control system< strong>, <strong>streamlined token contracts< strong>, and new libraries for <strong>enumerable mappings< strong>.< p>
<p>To install this latest release, run:< p>
<pre lang=""bash""><code>npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin contracts
< code>< pre>
<h2>What's New< h2>
<ul>
<li>All contracts were migrated to Solidity v0.6.< li>
<li><code>AccessControl< code> was designed <a href=""https:  forum.openzeppelin.com t redesigning-accesscontrol-for-the-openzeppelin-contracts 2177"">with help from the community< a> and has replaced <code>Roles< code> contracts (such as <code>MinterRole< code> and <code>PauserRole< code>), which were removed.< li>
<li>Crowdsales were removed: we'll continue to provide support for security issues on the v2.5 release, but will not bring them over to v3.0.< li>
<li>We've added <strong>hooks< strong>, a new feature of the library that will make extending it easier than ever.< li>
<li><code>ERC20< code> and <code>ERC721< code> were simplified and streamlined, including all optional parts of the standard by default, and simplifying some of our own custom extensions.< li>
<li>Support for better <code>mapping< code> types that let you efficiently iterate over all keys using <code>EnumerableSet< code> and <code>EnumerableMap< code>< li>
<li>Many, <em>many< em> breaking changes with small improvements. We've also moved some contracts around (e.g. <code>Ownable< code> is now found under the <code>access< code> directory) and deleted some that were not being used. Head to our <a href=""https:  github.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts blob master CHANGELOG.md"">changelog< a> to see the full list.< li>
< ul>
<h2>Compiling v0.6 Contracts< h2>
<p>You can use the <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com cli""><strong>OpenZeppelin CLI< strong>< a> to compile any Solidity v0.6 contract: just update the <code>pragma< code> statement on your source code and you'll be good to go!< p>
<pre lang=""solidity""><code>pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
< code>< pre>
<p>Note that you will need to use the <a href=""https:  forum.openzeppelin.com t openzeppelin-cli-2-7 2252"">v2.7 release of the CLI< a> or newer to have Solidity v0.6 support. For detailed information about using the CLI compiler, head to its <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com cli compiling"">documenation< a>.< p>
<h2>Revamped Access Control< h2>
<p>One of our most widely-used contracts is <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com contracts 3.x api access#Ownable""><code>Ownable< code>< a>, providing a simple authorization scheme. However, this fell short in complex systems with <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts issues 366"">multiple permissions< a>.< p>
<p>The v3.0 release introduces <code>AccessControl< code>, a one-stop-shop for all authorization needs. It lets you easily define multiple <strong>roles with different permissions< strong>, as well as <strong>which accounts are allowed to grant and revoke< strong> each role. It also boosts transparency by enabling <strong>enumeration of all privileged accounts< strong> in a system.< p>
<p><code>AccessControl< code> was designed with a security-first mindset, <a href=""https:  forum.openzeppelin.com t redesigning-accesscontrol-for-the-openzeppelin-contracts 2177"">receiving input from a wide array of users< a> and incorporating best practices in the field. Head to <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com contracts 3.x access-control#role-based-access-control"">our Access Control guide< a> for more information!< p>
<h2>Preset Contracts< h2>
<p>OpenZeppelin Contracts shine when you need the building blocks to get to the right feature set, but that's not all they can do! We've added a new family of <strong>Preset< strong> contracts starting with ERC20 and ERC721 tokens that you can quickly deploy as-is <strong>without having to write any Solidity code< strong>. Check out <a href=""https:  docs.openzeppelin.com contracts 3.x api presets"">their documentation!< a>< p>

<h2>0.7.0< h2>
<p>Hello!< p>
<p>Solidity-Coverage has undergone a major re-design in 0.7.0.< p>
<p>Its core remains the elegant solidity instrumentation logic which JoinColony engineer <a href=""https:  github.com area"">@area< a> first worked out in 2016. But the mechanics of collecting your tests' execution trace and the tool's integration with the Ethereum development stack have been re-written to fix a host of problems that have built up over the last two years. Beginning with this release, you'll< p>
<ul>
<li>be able to use any Ganache version you want< li>
<li>slot coverage into your other tooling as a plugin with much less configuration.< li>
<li>run into far fewer cases where normally working tests fail when being covered< li>
<li>be able to build your own coverage application using the tool's API.< li>
< ul>
<p>We've also focused on improving error reporting and making overall performance smoother. It's been beta tested  for several months on many of Ethereum's largest projects and everything looks good :)< p>

<h2>🐘  What's coming... 🐘< h2>
<p>Another major phase of development is scheduled for the next couple of months. We'll be implementing a set of new, solidity-specific coverage measurements which engineers have proposed over the years to increase the precision of the reports you get:< p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Per-function modifier coverage< strong> , which treats modifiers as branches in the code for each function, e.g for each method qualified by the modifier <code>Ownable< code>, measure whether it was called by owners <em>and< em> non-owners (Proposed by Zeppelin engineer Nicolas Venturo in [solidity-coverage <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com sc-forks solidity-coverage issues 286"">#286< a>](<a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com sc-forks solidity-coverage issues 286"">sc-forks solidity-coverage#286< a>))< li>
<li><strong>Public variable coverage< strong>, which treats public variables as methods (since getters are implicitly generated for them) and provide a way for developers to track changes in their contracts' public API. (Proposed by Zeppelin engineer Nicolas Venturo in [solidity-coverage <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com sc-forks solidity-coverage issues 281"">#281< a>](<a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com sc-forks solidity-coverage issues 281"">sc-forks solidity-coverage#281< a>))< li>
<li><strong>&amp;&amp;   ||  conditional coverage:< strong> , which treats conjoined conditions as distinct execution branches. This precision in branch coverage reporting is available for Java with the cobratura coverage tool - Solidity could benefit from it too. (Proposed by Gnosis engineer Richard Meissner in [solidity-coverage <a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com sc-forks solidity-coverage issues 175"">#175< a>](<a href=""https:  github-redirect.dependabot.com sc-forks solidity-coverage issues 175"">sc-forks solidity-coverage#175< a>))< li>
<li><strong>Documentation coverage< strong>, which  measures Natspec comment-to-parameter mappings and provides a way to track documentation completeness< li>
<li><strong>CI integrations for the above< strong> Where additional coverage measurements can't be adequately represented by Istanbul Coveralls we'll add support for them with a githooks CI integration that tracks pull-request changes relative to their target branch.< li>
< ul>
<p>Thanks for trying this out!< p>
<p><em>Please open issues ask for help if you run into trouble installing or see problems< em> ;)< p>
<h2>Buidler Plugin &amp; Coverage API< h2>
<p>Hi!< p>
<p><strong>Phase II< strong> of solidity-coverage's redesign is complete with this release. A long-standing goal here has been to make the tool more 'library-like' and decouple from any single development platform. <code>beta.3< code> moves in that direction by:< p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing an API< li>
<li>Using the API to create a coverage plugin for the Buidler development platform.< li>

oceanprotocol/contracts,74,Create Dependabot config file,":wave: Dependabot is moving natively into GitHub! This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax](https:  help.github.com en github administering-a-repository configuration-options-for-dependency-updates). When you merge this pull request, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!

With this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub](https:  github.com oceanprotocol ocean-contracts network updates), rather than the [Dependabot dashboard](https:  app.dependabot.com ), to monitor your version updates. Dependabot is now configured exclusively using config files.











If you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot feedback](https:  github.com dependabot feedback) repository.

oceanprotocol/contracts,73,Fix oceanprotocol ocean-contracts#72,,0,0,0,1
oceanprotocol/contracts,72,Fix: serviceFeeManager.calculateFee() fails,"I found this while working on ocean-lib-py. 

Summary: 
- EVM does a revert (fail) inexplicably in DataTokenTemplate.sol:mint() call to serviceFeeManager.calculateFee(). 
- Replacing the line to set the fee with a constant makes EVM not revert, but of course does not get the desired fees)
- Moving the calculations directly into DataTokenTemplate fixes it
- We can take the opportunity to simplify the fee calculation code too

To reproduce:
- Clone https:  github.com oceanprotocol ocean-lib-py tree issue6 at commit b478c77835e7f940cbeb265cb9649cc78deee20b
- Go through the steps of https:  github.com oceanprotocol ocean-lib-py blob master README_ocean-lib-developers.md on ganache. 
- It will fail during `. quickstart_simpleflow.py ganache`

```

A second issue: `address(serviceFeeManager).transfer(msg.value)` transfers _all_ the ETH in the message, even if it's much more than the fee size. This is uncool and could create some haters. Better to make it the fee size.",0,0,0,1

oceanprotocol/contracts,58,Feature: add approveAndLock() function,"In order to enable `consume` and `compute` features with data tokens we might consider to add `approveAndLock` function that will act similarly to an escrow functionality

Implementation:
**approveAndLock(to, amount)**
* sender is the owner of tokens
* to is address of the approved spender
* amount is total number of tokens to approve
* use a separate `Allowance` bucket

**transferAndUnlock(from, to, amount, locked_total)**
* sender is address of the approved spender from `approveAndLock`
* from is address of the original owner of approved tokens
* amount is number of tokens to transfer. This must be <= locked_total and <= total num approved tokens
* locked_total is number of tokens that were originally approved and locked, the remaining tokens (locked_total - amount) will be unlocked and returned to the original owner. This parameter is necessary to allow other amounts to remain locked and only unlock the amount applicable to the original allowance
* to is address of the receiver of transfered amount

oceanprotocol/contracts,50,Experimenting the publishing cost (mint) in ERC20 vs ERC721,"From @trentmc slides: 

Q: It’s cheap to mint a single new NFT token, because it’s just one tx. But publishing a whole ERC20 is expensive. So isn’t it too expensive to have an ERC20 for every datatoken? 
A: We found a way to keep it cheap: proxy contracts. They’re even cheaper than ERC721.

oceanprotocol/contracts,49,Feature: Batch minting in ERC20 vs ERC721,"From @trentmc slides:

Q: In ERC721, each token has a unique ID. But if I have batch minting, it will cost a lot of money because I’d have to loop one token at a time.
A: We’re not using ERC721. And if you were doing batch minting for a given data asset, that’s clearly a fungible token; you should be using ERC20

oceanprotocol/contracts,48,Feature: ERC20 Datatoken UX concerns,"From @trentmc slides

**_Concern:_** if there are 1000 different datatoken ERC20s, then (a) we’d need to add 1000 new contracts to metamask to see all of them. (b) Hard to visualize so many of them
Note: there is an L1 token registry 
Suggestion: (a) fork metamask, and use the L1 token registry to auto-populate this forked wallet. (b) Over time make it easier to sort them.

Q: If we make datatokens a “1st class citizen” on L3 Marketplace, will it hurt the UX?
A: There are designs that do not impair the UX
Approach: Don’t change the L3 *Marketplace* for datatokens, they’ll show up in Metamask   forked wallet anyway:). 

But also make it easy, from marketplace, to see the contract address for a given dataset. (The marketplace database should also use info from the **L1 token registry**.)

oceanprotocol/contracts,47,Publish as you go: Can ERC20 support multiple services for the same asset ?,"From @trentmc slides

Q: If I have more than one service for the same asset, how does that reconcile with ERC20?
A: We have >1 ERC20 contracts for the same asset. Each ERC20 is for a different service.

Q: If >1 ERC20 for the same asset, then publishing that asset becomes much more expensive
A: you would only publish new ERC20s for that asset if you see a need    you can make $
A2: publish it “just in time” when the first buyer comes along.
