OpenGenus/cosmos,6220,Fix critical time complexity issue of queue operation in python and javascript,"**Fixes issue:**
A standard Queue data structure should have O(1) time complexity for all basic operations.

Since the following two operations take O(N) time:
`self.data.insert(0, x)` in python
`store.shift();` in javascript

The time complexity of some `enqueue` and `dequeue` operation will become O(N) instead of O(1)

**Changes:**

Major:
1. Rewrite the python and javascript implementation of queue and fix the time complexity issue of `enqueue` and `dequeue` from O(N) to O(1).
2. This implementation need users to decide the queue size at initialization.

Minor:
1. Add `top` operation for getting the top element from queue.

The Playfair Cipher Encryption Algorithm: 
The Algorithm consists of 2 steps: 
 

1)Generate the key Square(5×5): 
    The key square is a 5×5 grid of alphabets that acts as the key for encrypting the plaintext. Each of the 25 alphabets must be 
    unique and one letter of the alphabet (usually J) is omitted from the table (as the table can hold only 25 alphabets). If the 
     plaintext contains J, then it is replaced by I. 
 
     The initial alphabets in the key square are the unique alphabets of the key in the order in which they appear followed by the 
     remaining letters of the alphabet in order. 
 
2) Algorithm to encrypt the plain text: The plaintext is split into pairs of two letters (digraphs). If there is an odd number of 
    letters, a Z is added to the last letter.

<!--Required Information-->

**This is a(n):**
<!-- choose one by changing [ ] to [x] -->
- [ Yes] New algorithm
- [ ] Update to an existing algorithm
- [ ] Error
- [ ] Proposal to the Repository

**Details:**
<!-- Details of algorithm to be added updated -->
The QuickHull algorithm is a Divide and Conquer algorithm similar to QuickSort. 
Let a[0…n-1] be the input array of points. Following are the steps for finding the convex hull of these points.

1. Find the point with minimum x-coordinate lets say, min_x and similarly the point with maximum x-coordinate, max_x.
    Make a line joining these two points, say L. This line will divide the whole set into two parts. Take both the parts one by one 
    and proceed further.

2. For a part, find the point P with maximum distance from the line L. P forms a triangle with the points min_x, max_x. It is clear 
    that the points residing inside this triangle can never be the part of convex hull.

3. The above step divides the problem into two sub-problems (solved recursively). Now the line joining the points P and min_x 
    and the line joining the points P and max_x are new lines and the points residing outside the triangle is the set of points. 

4. Repeat point no. 3 till there no point left with the line. Add the end points of this point to the convex hull.

Add Cichelli's Perfect Hashing Algorithm in Java with text files

Cichelli's Method is implemented to minimize the number of collisions when mapping values to a hash table, using a hash function. This program reads keywords from a text file and inserts these keywords into a hash table by following Cichelli's method. The program then reads a second text file of words and compares these words to the keywords with the aid of the hash function. Finally the program prints statistics such as the number of keywords present in the second text file.

OpenGenus/cosmos,5907,[Hacktoberfest] Contribution guide at OpenGenus Cosmos 🌱,"You may use this guide to make quality contributions at **Hacktoberfest 2020**: [Hacktoberfest 2020 guide](https:  iq.opengenus.org hacktoberfest-2020 )

---

To begin contributing, you shall get a quick overview of how Cosmos is used today. **Cosmos** is one of the most extensive code database and is used as:

* A datastore for various projects (such as [Quark](https:  github.com OpenGenus quark)) for purposes such as offline searching
* Training ML models for applications such as identifying programming language
* Metadata for projects such as [OpenGenus IQ](https:  iq.opengenus.org ), [Falcon](https:  github.com OpenGenus falcon) and several others
* Offline Learning resource by several contributors

To get started on your journey of making Cosmos and related OpenGenus projects better, follow the following steps:

* Fork Cosmos to get a local copy as your workspace
* Learn how to make a perfect pull request ([guide](https:  iq.opengenus.org create-a-pull-request-at-github ))
* Make a basic contribution like improving existing implementations, simple bugs (like #5891) and more to get familiar with the flow
* Make quality contributions ([more details](https:  iq.opengenus.org hacktoberfest-2020 )). This helps you in multiple angles

Some quality contributions:

* Implement new algorithms in language of your choice (Having strong implementation skills is useful)
* Write at OpenGenus IQ on a topic you are confident in or prepare questions on a given topic (Ability to explain ideas is important)
* Write at OpenGenus IQ on a new topic in the domain you are interested in (Approaching new topics correctly is the key to invention)
* Develop features for sister projects of Cosmos (challenging but interesting)

We, strongly, suggest you to you us as an author (apply to be [an author](https:  discourse.opengenus.org t become-a-writer-at-opengenus-iq 843) or [an Intern](http:  internship.opengenus.org)) and write on topics of your choice. We add this as a metadata to Cosmos (for example: #5830) which makes it complete.

This helps you grow intellectually 🧠 and help you gain good opportunities. Search and ask our Interns how they have grown over the years.

OpenGenus/cosmos,5881,Specify ascending descending property for comparison based sorts,"<!-- Thanks for filing an issue! Before submitting, please fill in the following information. -->

<!--Required Information-->

**Details:**
<!-- Details of algorithm to be added updated -->
Comparison based sorting algorithms can have two results: the object is either sorted in ascending or descending order. From what I see, most of the algorithms submitted here assume ascending order, but this can be easily resolved if an additional boolean parameter is passed to the sort function to specify the ascending descending property. This would also entail changing the test files which depend upon the sort function accepting only the object as a parameter.

OpenGenus/cosmos,5880,Optimize for partially sorted arrays,"**Fixes issue:**
The first implementation for bubble sort does not terminate if the array is already sorted in one of the iterations, like the second implementation does. 


**Changes:**
Added a flag at the beginning of the outer loop that is modified if any swap is made during an iteration. If no swaps are made, then the array is already sorted and the algorithm terminates.

OpenGenus/cosmos,5839,added efficient 3 partition method for quick sort,"Worse than Average Case

For quick sort, we could imagine a worse than average case where we get unlucky and:
- for odd levels we choose the worst possible pivot i.e. all elements are to the left or right of the pivot
- for even levels, we choose pivots where 3 4 of the elements are on one side and 1 4 on the other side
- so roughly, after every 2 levels, our biggest subproblem is 3 4 of the size it was 2 levels before
- so now it takes 2 * log_(4 3) (n) levels until the size of the problem is 1
(Why?
n * (3 4)^x = 1, tells us how many times, x, that we have to multiply n by 3 4 to get 1
Solving for x gives us x - log_(4 3) (n), but we have to double it since we only multiply
by 3 4 on every second level)

The average case is better than this worse than the average case.

So, the average case is between the best case of log_2(n) levels and the worst than average case of 2 * log_(4 3) (n) levels
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using random pivoting we improve the expected or average time complexity to O (N log N). The Worst-Case complexity is still O ( N^2 ).

OpenGenus/cosmos,5601,Codechef Coronavirus Spread in C++,"**Problem Link**
[Coronavirus Spread](https:  www.codechef.com MAY20B problems COVID19)

**Details:**
There are N people on a street (numbered 1 through N). For simplicity, we'll view them as points on a line. For each valid i, the position of the i-th person is Xi.

It turns out that exactly one of these people is infected with the virus COVID-19, but we do not know which one. The virus will spread from an infected person to a non-infected person whenever the distance between them is at most 2. If we wait long enough, a specific set of people (depending on the person that was infected initially) will become infected; let's call the size of this set the final number of infected people.

Your task is to find the smallest and largest value of the final number of infected people, i.e. this number in the best and in the worst possible scenario.

**Details:**
To protect people from evil, a long and tall wall was constructed a few years ago. But just a wall is not safe, there should also be soldiers on it, always keeping vigil. The wall is very long and connects the left and the right towers. There are exactly N spots (numbered 1 to N) on the wall for soldiers. The Kth spot is K miles far from the left tower and (N+1-K) miles from the right tower.

Given a permutation of spots P of {1, 2, ..., N}, soldiers occupy the N spots in that order. The P[i]th spot is occupied before the P[i+1]th spot. When a soldier occupies a spot, he is connected to his nearest soldier already placed to his left. If there is no soldier to his left, he is connected to the left tower. The same is the case with right side. A connection between two spots requires a wire of length equal to the distance between the two.

The realm has already purchased a wire of M miles long from Nokia, possibly the wire will be cut into smaller length wires. As we can observe, the total length of the used wire depends on the permutation of the spots P. Help the realm in minimizing the length of the unused wire. If there is not enough wire, output -1.

Being new to both the Go programming language and github contributions, I want to make a small contribution to  cosmos code bit_manipulation src addition_using_bits.  I noticed that there is not yet a Go version of the algorithm.  I believe I have already created the solution in my addition_using_bits.go and would love to have it reviewed and merged with the project.  I will be opening a pull request.

There are a number of people who will be attending ACM-ICPC World Finals. Each of 
them may be well versed in a number of topics. Given a list of topics known by 
each attendee, you must determine the maximum number of topics a 2-person team can 
know. Also find out how many ways a team can be formed to know that many topics. 
Lists will be in the form of bit strings, where each string represents an attendee 
and each position in that string represents a field of knowledge, 1 if its a known 
field or 0 if not.

For example, given three attendees' data as follows:

10101
11110
00010
These are all possible teams that can be formed:

Members Subjects
(1,2)   [1,2,3,4,5]
(1,3)   [1,3,4,5]
(2,3)   [1,2,3,4]
In this case, the first team will know all 5 subjects. They are the only team that 
can be created knowing that many subjects.

Taum is planning to celebrate the birthday of his friend, Diksha. There are two 
types of gifts that Diksha wants from Taum: one is black and the other is white. 
To make her happy, Taum has to buy b black gifts and w white gifts.

The cost of each black gift is bc units.
The cost of every white gift is wc units.
The cost of converting each black gift into white gift or vice versa is z units.
Help Taum by deducing the minimum amount he needs to spend on Diksha's gifts.

For example, if Taum wants to buy b=3 black gifts and w=5 white gifts at a cost of 
bc = 3, wc = 4 and conversion cost z = 1, we see that he can buy a black gift for 
3 and convert it to a white gift for 1, making the total cost of each white gift 
4. That matches the cost of a white gift, so he can do that or just buy black 
gifts and white gifts. Either way, the overall cost is 3 * 3 + 5 * 4 = 29.

A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property. If 
you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers, you 
have the same value you started with.

Consider a positive whole number  with  digits. We square  to arrive at a number 
that is either 2 * D digits long or (2 * d) - 1 digits long. Split the string 
representation of the square into two parts, l and r. The right hand part, r must 
be d digits long. The left is the remaining substring. Convert those two 
substrings back to integers, add them and see if you get n.

For example, if n = 5, d = 1 then (n)^2 = 25. We split that into two strings and 
convert them back to integers 2 and 5. We test 2 + 5 =7, so this is not a modified 
Kaprekar number. If n = 9, still d = 1, and n^2 = 81. This gives us 1 + 8 = 9, the 
original n.

Note: r may have leading zeros.

Here's an explanation from Wikipedia about the ORIGINAL Kaprekar Number (spot the 
difference!):

Given a sequence of integers a, a triplet (a[i], a[j], a[k]) is beautiful if:
1. i < j < k
2. a[j] - a[i] = a[k] - a[j] = d
Given an increasing sequenc of integers and the value of d, count the number of 
beautiful triplets in the sequence.

For example, the sequence arr = [2, 2, 3, 4, 5] and d = 1. There are three 
beautiful triplets, by index: [i, j, k] = [0, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]. To test 
the first triplet, arr[j] - arr[i] = 3 - 2 = 1 and arr[k] - arr[j] = 4 - 3 = 1.

We define the distance between two array values as the number of indices between 
the two values. Given a, find the minimum distance between any pair of equal 
elements in the array. If no such value exists, print -1.

For example, if a = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3], there are two matching pairs of values: 3 and 
2. The indices of the 3's are i = 0 and i = 4, so their distance is d[i,j] = |j - 
i| = 4. The indices of the 2's are i = 1 and , so their distance is d[i,j] = |j - 
i| = 2.

You wish to buy video games from the famous online video game store Mist.

Usually, all games are sold at the same price, p dollars. However, they are 
planning to have the seasonal Halloween Sale next month in which you can buy games 
at a cheaper price. Specifically, the first game you buy during the sale will be 
sold at p dollars, but every subsequent game you buy will be sold at exactly d 
dollars less than the cost of the previous one you bought. This will continue 
until the cost becomes less than or equal to m dollars, after which every game you 
buy will cost m dollars each.

For example, if p = 20, d = 3 and m = 6, then the following are the costs of the 
first 11 games you buy, in order:
                     20, 17, 14, 11, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
You have s dollars in your Mist wallet. How many games can you buy during the 
Halloween Sale?",0,0,0,1

Calvin is driving his favorite vehicle on the 101 freeway. He notices that the 
check engine light of his vehicle is on, and he wants to service it immediately to 
avoid any risks. Luckily, a service lane runs parallel to the highway. The service 
lane varies in width along its length.

Paradise Highway

You will be given an array of widths at points along the road (indices), then a 
list of the indices of entry and exit points. Considering each entry and exit 
point pair, calculate the maximum size vehicle that can travel that segment of the 
service lane safely.

For example, there are n = 4 measurements yielding width = [2, 3, 2, 1]. If our 
entry index, i = 1 and our exit, j = 2, there are two segment widths of 2 and 3 
respectively. The widest vehicle that can fit through both is 2. If i = 2 and j = 
4, our widths are [3, 2, 1] which limits vehicle width to 1.

**Details:**
Andy and Bob are the only two delivery men of Pizza-chef store. Today, the store received N orders. It's known that the amount of tips may be different when handled by different delivery man. More specifically, if Andy takes the ith order, he would be tipped Ai dollars and if Bob takes this order, the tip would be Bi dollars.

They decided that they would distribute the orders among themselves to maximize the total tip money. One order will be handled by only one person. Also, due to time constraints Andy cannot take more than X orders and Bob cannot take more than Y orders. It is guaranteed that X + Y is greater than or equal to N, which means that all the orders can be handled by either Andy or Bob.

Please find out the maximum possible amount of total tip money after processing all the orders.

set A contain all numbers from 1 to N and set B contain all numbers from N + 1 to 
2N. Multiset C contains all sums a + b such that a belongs to A and b belongs to 
B. Note that multiset may contain several elements with the same values. For 
example, if N equals to three, then A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {4, 5, 6} and C = {5, 6, 6, 
7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9}. Andrii has M queries about multiset C. Every query is defined

C. For example, number 6 is contained two times, 1 is not contained in C at all.

A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].

Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().

A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].

By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:
1. It contains no unmatched brackets.
2. The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
Given n strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.

Little Bobby loves chocolate. He frequently goes to his favorite 5 & 10 store, 
Penny Auntie, to buy them. They are having a promotion at Penny Auntie. If Bobby 
saves enough wrappers, he can turn them in for a free chocolate.

For example, Bobby has n = 15 to spend on bars of chocolate that cost c = 3 each. 
He can turn in m = 2 wrappers to receive another bar. Initially, he buys 5 bars 
and has 5 wrappers after eating them. He turns in 4 of them, leaving him with 1, 
for 2 more bars. After eating those two, he has 2 wrappers, turns in 2 leaving him 
with 1 wrapper and his new bar. Once he eats that one, he has 1 wrappers and turns 
them in for another bar. After eating that one, he only has  wrapper, and his 
feast ends. Overall, he has eaten 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9 bars.

Sereja conducted a voting about N of his opinions. Ai percent of people voted for opinion number i. This statistics is called valid if sum of all Ai is equal to 100.

Now let us define rounding up of a statistics A.

If Ai is not an integer, it will be rounded up to next integer.
Otherwise it will be left as it is.
e.g. 4.1 became 5, 4.9 became 5 but 6 will still be 6.
Now let us consider a statistics B of size N in which each of Bi is an integer. Now he wants to know whether there exists some valid statistic A of size N (may contain real numbers) such that after rounding it up, it becomes same as B?

It is winter super sale and all the shops have various offers. Suraj selected N 
items to buy and he is standing in the billing queue. It was then he noticed the 
offer ""Buy two, get two"". That means for every two items you buy, they give you 
two items for free. However, items can be of varying price, they always charge for 
2 most costly items and give other 2 as free. For example, if the items cost 1, 1, 
2, 2, then you have to pay 4 and take all 4 items.

Suraj is busy reordering his items to reduce the total price he has to pay. He can 
separate the items and get them on different bills if needed. Can you tell me what 
is the least price Suraj has to pay to buy all the N items?

Chef and his girlfriend are going to have a promenade. They are walking along the 
straight road which consists of segments placed one by one. Before walking Chef 
and his girlfriend stay at the beginning of the first segment, they want to 
achieve the end of the last segment.

There are few problems:

At the beginning Chef should choose constant integer - the velocity of mooving. It 
can't be changed inside one segment.
The velocity should be decreased by at least 1 after achieving the end of some 
segment.
There is exactly one shop on each segment. Each shop has an attractiveness. If 
it's attractiveness is W and Chef and his girlfriend move with velocity V then if 
V < W girlfriend will run away into the shop and the promenade will become ruined.
Chef doesn't want to lose her girl in such a way, but he is an old one, so you 
should find the minimal possible velocity at the first segment to satisfy all 
conditions.

whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, 
numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Chef has a positive integer N. He can apply any of the following operations as 
many times as he want in any order:

Add 1 to the number N.
Take some digit of N and replace it by any non-zero digit.
Add any non-zero leading digit to N.
Find the minimum number of operations that is needed for changing N to the lucky 
number.

At the end of a busy day, The Chef and his assistants play a game together. The 
game is not just for fun but also used to decide who will have to clean the 
kitchen. The Chef is a Game Master, so his concern is how to manage the game but 
not how to win the game like his assistants do.

The game requires players to find the only ball under one of the N cups after 
their positions are changed in a special way. At the beginning of the game, The 
Chef places N cups in a row and put a ball under the C-th cup from the left (the 
cups are numbered from 1 to N). All players can see the initial position of the 
ball. Then Chef performs Q flip operations. Each flip operation is defined by two 
integers L and R such that 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N and consists in reversing the segment [L, 
R] of cups. Namely, Chef swaps L-th and R-th cups, (L+1)-th and (R−1)-th cups, and 
so on. After performing all the operations Chef asks his assistants to choose a 
cup that they think the ball is under it. Who can guess the position of the ball 
will win the game, and of course, the others will have to clean the kitchen.

The Chef doesn't want to check all the N cups at the end of the game. He notes 
down the value of C and the pairs (L, R) and asked you, the mastered programmer, 
to determine the cup that contains the ball.

**Details:**
Alice has learnt factorization recently. Bob doesn't think she has learnt it properly and hence he has decided to quiz her. Bob gives Alice a very large number and asks her to find out the number of factors of that number. To make it a little easier for her, he represents the number as a product of N numbers. Alice is frightened of big numbers and hence is asking you for help. Your task is simple. Given N numbers, you need to tell the number of distinct factors of the product of these N numbers.

Flatland is a country with a number of cities, some of which have space stations. 
Cities are numbered consecutively and each has a road of 1km length connecting it 
to the next city. It is not a circular route, so the first city doesn't connect 
with the last city. Determine the maximum distance from any city to it's nearest 
space station.

For example, there are n = 3 cities and m = 1 of them has a space station, city 1. 
They occur consecutively along a route. City 2 is 2 - 1 = 1 unit away and city 3 
is 3 - 1 = 2 units away. City 1 is 0 units from its nearest space station as one 
is located there. The maximum distance is 2.

Did you ever hear about 'Dragon Food' ? Its used to refer to the chocolates bought 
for your loved ones :). Po offers dragon food to master Shifu, who is a famous 
cook in the valley of food. In return, Shifu hands over the dragon scroll to Po, 
which is said to hold the ingredients of the secret recipe. To open the dragon 
scroll, one has to solve the following puzzle.

1. Consider a N-bit integer A. We call an integer A' as shuffle-A, if A' can be 
obtained by shuffling the bits of A in its binary representation. For eg. if N = 5 
and A = 6 = (00110)2, A' can be any 5-bit integer having exactly two 1s in it i.e.
, any of (00011)2, (00101)2, (00110)2, (01010)2, ...., (11000)2.

2. Given two N-bit integers A and B, find the maximum possible value of (A' xor 
B') where A' is a shuffle-A, B' is a shuffle-B and xor is the bit-wise xor 
operator.

Given N, A and B, please help Po in opening the dragon scroll.

Notes 1. xor operator takes two bit strings of equal length and performs the 
logical XOR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each 
position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 OR only the second bit is 1, but will be 
0 if both are 1 or both are 0. For eg: 5 (0101) xor 3(0011) = 6(0110). In most 
languages it is represented using ^ symbol. 5 ^ 3 = 6.
2. If the integer actually needs less than N bits to represent in binary, append 
sufficient number of leading 0 bits. For eg. as shown in the problem statement for 
N = 5, A = 6 = (00110)2",0,0,0,0

In a far away dystopian world, the measure of the quality of a person’s life is 
the numbers of likes he gets for an article about their life. For a person to stay 
alive, he has to acquire at least L number of likes before D days pass.

People in this world employ various techniques to increase the number of likes. 
One of the famous ones is to dis-like and re-like their own article once per day. 
On doing so you can assume that the number of likes for the post increase by a 
constant factor C.

So if one starts with S likes on Day-1, he would have D2 = S + C * S likes on 
Day-2, D3 = D2 + D2 * C on Day-3 etc. You are to answer if the person would 
survive at the end of Day-D or not.",0,0,0,0

You are the benevolent ruler of Rankhacker Castle, and today you're distributing 
bread. Your subjects are in a line, and some of them already have some loaves. 
Times are hard and your castle's food stocks are dwindling, so you must distribute 
as few loaves as possible according to the following rules:

1 Every time you give a loaf of bread to some person i, you must also give a loaf 
of bread to the person immediately in front of or behind them in the line (i.e., 
persons i+1  or i-1 ).

2 After all the bread is distributed, each person must have an even number of 
loaves.
Given the number of loaves already held by each citizen, find and print the 
minimum number of loaves you must distribute to satisfy the two rules above. If 
this is not possible, print NO.

For example, the people in line have loaves B = [4,5,6,7]. We can first give a 
loaf to i = 3 and i = 4 so B = [4,5,7,8]. Next we give a loaf to i = 2  and i = 3  
and have B = [4,5,8,8] which satisfies our conditions. We had to distribute 4 
loaves.

There are N+1 lights. Lights are placed at (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0) ... (N, 0). 
Initially all the lights are on. You want to turn off all of them one after one. 
You want to follow a special pattern in turning off the lights.

You will start at (0, 0). First, you walk to the right most light that is on, turn 
it off. Then you walk to the left most light that is on, turn it off. Then again 
to the right most light that is on and so on. You will stop after turning off all 
lights. You want to know how much distance you walked in the process. Note that 
distance between (a,0) and (b,0) is |a-b|.

Lira is now very keen on compiler development. :)

She knows that one of the most important components of a compiler, is its parser.

A parser is, in simple terms, a software component that processes text, and checks 
it's semantic correctness, or, if you prefer, if the text is properly built.

As an example, in declaring and initializing an integer, in C C++, you can't do 
something like:

int = x ;4

as the semantics of such statement is incorrect, as we all know that the datatype 
must precede an identifier and only afterwards should come the equal sign and the 
initialization value, so, the corrected statement should be:

int x = 4;

Today, Lira is concerned with an abstract instruction which is composed of the 
characters ""<"" and "">"" , which she will use on the design of her language, L++ :D.

She is using it as an abstraction for generating XML code Tags in an easier 
fashion and she understood that, for an expression to be valid, a ""<"" symbol must 
always have a corresponding "">"" character somewhere (not necessary immediately) 
after it. Moreover, each "">"" symbol should correspond to exactly one ""<"" symbol.

So, for instance, the instructions:

<<>>

<>

<><>

are all valid. While:

>>

><><

are not.

Given some expressions which represent some instructions to be analyzed by Lira's 
compiler, you should tell the length of the longest prefix of each of these 
expressions that is valid, or 0 if there's no such a prefix.

Chef loves circular cakes. He divides them into smaller pieces and sells them. You 
are to help him in this work.

Today Chef has cooked the brand new circular cake. To split the cake Chef can make 
several (possibly, zero) cuts. Each cut should be a straight line going from the 
center of the cake to its border. Also, the angle between any two cuts should have 
positive integer value (Chef measure all the angles in degrees). Chef consider two 
pieces of cake equal if the appropriate angles are equal.


The picture contains two distinct pieces, and two cuts. Red part on the image 
shows one piece. The appropriate angle is AOB.

Chef gives to you an integer N, denoting the number of pieces Chef wants to make. 
You need to answer the following questions:

Is it possible to make exactly N equal pieces from the whole cake?
Is it possible to make exactly N pieces from the whole cake?
Is it possible to make exactly N pieces from the whole cake, in such a way that no 
two of them are equal?

We consider permutations of the numbers 1,..., N for some N. By permutation we 
mean a rearrangment of the number 1,...,N. For example

2  4  5  1  7  6  3  8
is a permutation of 1,2,...,8. Of course,

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
is also a permutation of 1,2,...,8.

We can ""walk around"" a permutation in a interesting way and here is how it is done 
for the permutation above:

Start at position 1. At position 1 we have 2 and so we go to position 2. Here we 
find 4 and so we go to position 4. Here we find 1, which is a position that we 
have already visited. This completes the first part of our walk and we denote this 
walk by (1 2 4 1). Such a walk is called a cycle. An interesting property of such 
walks, that you may take for granted, is that the position we revisit will always 
be the one we started from!

We continue our walk by jumping to first unvisited position, in this case position 
3 and continue in the same manner. This time we find 5 at position 3 and so we go 
to position 5 and find 7 and we go to position 7 and find 3 and thus we get the 
cycle (3 5 7 3). Next we start at position 6 and get (6 6) and finally we start at 
position 8 and get the cycle (8 8). We have exhausted all the positions. Our walk 
through this permutation consists of 4 cycles.

One can carry out this walk through any permutation and obtain a set of cycles as 
the result. Your task is to print out the cycles that result from walking through 
a given permutation.g

In an attempt to control the rise in population, Archer was asked to come up with 
a plan. This time he is targeting marriages. Archer, being as intelligent as he 
is, came up with the following plan:

A man with name M is allowed to marry a woman with name W, only if M is a 
subsequence of W or W is a subsequence of M.

A is said to be a subsequence of B, if A can be obtained by deleting some elements 
of B without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Your task is to determine whether a couple is allowed to marry or not, according 
to Archer's rule.

The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv currently is on the military mission. 
There are N enemy buildings placed in a row and numbered from left to right 
strating from 0. Each building i (except the first and the last) has exactly two 
adjacent buildings with indices i-1 and i+1. The first and the last buildings have 
just a single adjacent building.

Some of the buildings contain bombs. When bomb explodes in some building it 
destroys it and all adjacent to it buildings.

You are given the string S of length N, where Si is 1 if the i-th building 
contains bomb, 0 otherwise. Find for the Little Elephant the number of buildings 
that will not be destroyed after all bombs explode. Please note that all bombs

You had an array of integer numbers. You also had a 
beautiful operations called ""Copy-Paste"" which 
allowed you to copy any contiguous subsequence of 
your array and paste it in any position of your 
array. For example, if you have array [1, 2, 3, 4, 
5] and copy it's subsequence from the second to the 
fourth element and paste it after the third one, 
then you will get [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5] array. 
You remember that you have done a finite(probably 
zero) number of such operations over your initial 
array and got an array A as a result. Unfortunately 
you don't remember the initial array itself, so you 
would like to know what could it be. You are 
interested by the smallest such array. So the task 
is to find the minimal size(length) of the array 
that A can be obtained from by using ""Copy-Paste"" 
operations.

A tourist is visiting Byteland. The tourist knows 
English very well. The language of Byteland is 
rather different from English. To be exact it 
differs in following points:

Bytelandian alphabet has the same letters as English 
one, but possibly different in meaning. Like 'A' in 
Bytelandian may be 'M' in English. However this does 
not mean that 'M' in Bytelandian must be 'A' in 
English. More formally, Bytelindian alphabet is a 
permutation of English alphabet. It will be given to 
you and could be any possible permutation. Don't 
assume any other condition.
People of Byteland don't like to use invisible 
character for separating words. Hence instead of 
space (' ') they use underscore ('_'). Other 
punctuation symbols, like '?', '!' remain the same 
as in English.
The tourist is carrying ""The dummies guide to 
Bytelandian"", for translation. The book is serving 
his purpose nicely. But he is addicted to sharing on 
BaceFook, and shares his numerous conversations in 
Byteland on it. The conversations are rather long, 
and it is quite tedious to translate for his English 
friends, so he asks you to help him by writing a 
program to do the same.

[Splitting Candies](https:  www.codechef.com problems SPCANDY)


**Description**
Cyael is a teacher at a very famous school in Byteland and she is known by her students for being very polite to them and also to encourage them to get good marks on their tests.

Then, if they get good marks she will reward them with candies :) However, she knows they are all very good at Mathematics, so she decided to split the candies evenly to all the students she considers worth of receiving them, so they don't fight with each other.

She has a bag which initially contains N candies and she intends to split the candies evenly to K students. To do this she will proceed as follows: while she has more than K candies she will give exactly 1 candy to each student until she has less than K candies. On this situation, as she can't split candies equally among all students she will keep the remaining candies to herself.

Your job is to tell how many candies will each student and the teacher receive after the splitting is performed.

<img width=""1016"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-04-01 at 6 04 18 PM"" src=""https:  user-images.githubusercontent.com 30810402 78191051-36d85700-7443-11ea-908b-e102ae86d1c9.png"">

It would seem that Jupyter notebooks constitute the majority of the code in the codebase. Obviously this is not true (there are I think 11 notebooks in this repository). The nature of Jupyter notebooks is that they take up many lines of code. Unfortunately, this means that this project is incorrectly classified in terms of Linguist. 

Based on github linguist#3316, it seems the solution is to mark the Jupyter Notebook files as either vendored or documentation in the `.gitattributes` file (or to mark them for a specific language, although I doubt this is a good idea because then stats for that language will be skewed).

If anyone wants to do this, comment below.

For her next karate demonstration, Ada will break some bricks.

Ada stacked three bricks on top of each other. Initially, their widths (from top to bottom) are W1,W2,W3.

Ada's strength is S. Whenever she hits a stack of bricks, consider the largest k≥0 such that the sum of widths of the topmost k bricks does not exceed S; the topmost k bricks break and are removed from the stack. Before each hit, Ada may also decide to reverse the current stack of bricks, with no cost.

Find the minimum number of hits Ada needs in order to break all bricks if she performs the reversals optimally. You are not required to minimise the number of reversals.

Cyael is a teacher at a very famous school in Byteland and she is known by her 
students for being very polite to them and also to encourage them to get good marks 
on their tests.

Then, if they get good marks she will reward them with candies :) However, she knows 
they are all very good at Mathematics, so she decided to split the candies evenly to 
all the students she considers worth of receiving them, so they don't fight with 
each other.

She has a bag which initially contains N candies and she intends to split the 
candies evenly to K students. To do this she will proceed as follows: while she has 
more than K candies she will give exactly 1 candy to each student until she has less 
than K candies. On this situation, as she can't split candies equally among all 
students she will keep the remaining candies to herself.

Your job is to tell how many candies will each student and the teacher receive after 
the splitting is performed.

Our Chef is catering for a big corporate office party and is busy preparing 
different mouth watering dishes. The host has insisted that he serves his delicious 
cupcakes for dessert.

On the day of the party, the Chef was over-seeing all the food arrangements as well, 
ensuring that every item was in its designated position. The host was satisfied with 
everything except the cupcakes. He noticed they were arranged neatly in the shape of 
a rectangle. He asks the Chef to make it as square-like as possible.

The Chef is in no mood to waste his cupcakes by transforming it into a perfect 
square arrangement. Instead, to fool the host, he asks you to arrange the N cupcakes 
as a rectangle so that the difference between the length and the width is minimized.

[Chopsticks (singular: chopstick) are short, frequently tapered sticks used in pairs 
of equal length, which are used as the traditional eating utensils of China, Japan, 
Korea and Vietnam. Originated in ancient China, they can also be found in some areas 
of Tibet and Nepal that are close to Han Chinese populations, as well as areas of 
Thailand, Laos and Burma which have significant Chinese populations. Chopsticks are 
most commonly made of wood, bamboo or plastic, but in China, most are made out of 
bamboo. Chopsticks are held in the dominant hand, between the thumb and fingers, and 
used to pick up pieces of food.]

Retrieved from wikipedia

Actually, the two sticks in a pair of chopsticks need not be of the same length. A 
pair of sticks can be used to eat as long as the difference in their length is at 
most D. The Chef has N sticks in which the ith stick is L[i] units long. A stick 
can't be part of more than one pair of chopsticks. Help the Chef in pairing up the 
sticks to form the maximum number of usable pairs of chopsticks.

Are you fond of collecting some kind of stuff? Mike is crazy about 
collecting stamps. He is an active member of Stamp Collecting Сommunity(SCC)
.

SCC consists of N members which are fond of philately. A few days ago Mike 
argued with the others from SCC. Mike told them that all stamps of the 
members could be divided in such a way that i'th member would get i postage 
stamps. Now Mike wants to know if he was right. The next SCC meeting is 
tomorrow. Mike still has no answer.

So, help Mike! There are N members in the SCC, i'th member has Ci stamps in 
his collection. Your task is to determine if it is possible to redistribute 
C1 + C2 + ... + Cn stamps among the members of SCC thus that i'th member 
would get i stamps.

As you might remember, the collector of Siruseri had ordered a complete 
revision of the Voters List. He knew that constructing the list of voters 
is a difficult task, prone to errors. Some voters may have been away on 
vacation, others may have moved during the enrollment and so on.

To be as accurate as possible, he entrusted the task to three different 
officials. Each of them was to independently record the list of voters and 
send it to the collector. In Siruseri, every one has a ID number and the 
list would only list the ID numbers of the voters and not their names. The 
officials were expected to arrange the ID numbers in ascending order in 
their lists.

On receiving the lists, the Collector realised that there were 
discrepancies - the three lists were not identical. He decided to go with 
the majority. That is, he decided to construct the final list including 
only those ID numbers that appeared in at least 2 out of the 3 lists. For 
example if the three lists were

23  30  42  57  90
21  23  35  57  90  92
21  23  30  57  90 
then the final list compiled by the collector would be:

21  23  30  57  90
The ID numbers 35, 42 and 92 which appeared in only one list each do not 
figure in the final list.

Your task is to help the collector by writing a program that produces the 
final list from the three given lists.

**Details:**
<!-- Details of algorithm to be added updated -->
Pip has N strings. Each string consists only of letters from A to Z. Pip would like to bundle their strings into groups of size K. Each string must belong to exactly one group.

The score of a group is equal to the length of the longest prefix shared by all the strings in that group. For example:
- The group {RAINBOW, RANK, RANDOM, RANK} has a score of 2 (the longest prefix is 'RA').
- The group {FIRE, FIREBALL, FIREFIGHTER} has a score of 4 (the longest prefix is 'FIRE').
- The group {ALLOCATION, PLATE, WORKOUT, BUNDLING} has a score of 0 (the longest prefix is '').

Please help Pip bundle their strings into groups of size K, such that the sum of scores of the groups is maximized.

Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the two integers N and K. Then, N lines follow, each containing one of Pip's strings.

Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum sum of scores possible.",0,0,0,0

The Little Elephant likes permutations. This time he has a permutation A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] of numbers 1, 2, ..., N.

He calls a permutation A good, if the number of its inversions is equal to the number of its local inversions. The number of inversions is equal to the number of pairs of integers (i; j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N and A[i] > A[j], and the number of local inversions is the number of integers i such that 1 ≤ i < N and A[i] > A[i+1].

The Little Elephant has several such permutations. Help him to find for each permutation whether it is good or not. Print YES for a corresponding test case if it is good and NO otherwise.

Lots of geeky customers visit our chef's restaurant everyday. So, when asked to fill the feedback form, these customers represent the feedback using a binary string (i.e a string that contains only characters '0' and '1'.

Now since chef is not that great in deciphering binary strings, he has decided the following criteria to classify the feedback as Good or Bad :

If the string contains the substring ""010"" or ""101"", then the feedback is Good, else it is Bad. Note that, to be Good it is not necessary to have both of them as substring.

So given some binary strings, you need to output whether according to the chef, the strings are Good or Bad.",1,1,0,0

Little chief has his own restaurant in the city. There are N workers there. Each worker has his own salary. The salary of the i-th worker equals to Wi (i = 1, 2, ..., N). Once, chief decided to equalize all workers, that is, he wants to make salaries of all workers to be equal. But for this goal he can use only one operation: choose some worker and increase by 1 salary of each worker, except the salary of the chosen worker. In other words, the chosen worker is the loser, who will be the only worker, whose salary will be not increased during this particular operation. But loser-worker can be different for different operations, of course. Chief can use this operation as many times as he wants. But he is a busy man. That's why he wants to minimize the total number of operations needed to equalize all workers. Your task is to find this number.

Chef has gone shopping with his 5-year old son. They have bought N items so far. The items are numbered from 1 to N, and the item i weighs Wi grams.

Chef's son insists on helping his father in carrying the items. He wants his dad to give him a few items. Chef does not want to burden his son. But he won't stop bothering him unless he is given a few items to carry. So Chef decides to give him some items. Obviously, Chef wants to give the kid less weight to carry.

However, his son is a smart kid. To avoid being given the bare minimum weight to carry, he suggests that the items are split into two groups, and one group contains exactly K items. Then Chef will carry the heavier group, and his son will carry the other group.

Help the Chef in deciding which items should the son take. Your task will be simple. Tell the Chef the maximum possible difference between the weight carried by him and the weight carried by the kid.

Soma is a fashionable girl. She absolutely loves shiny stones that she can put on as jewellery accessories. She has been collecting stones since her childhood - now she has become really good with identifying which ones are fake and which ones are not. Her King requested for her help in mining precious stones, so she has told him which all stones are jewels and which are not. Given her description, your task is to count the number of jewel stones.

More formally, you're given a string J composed of latin characters where each character is a jewel. You're also given a string S composed of latin characters where each character is a mined stone. You have to find out how many characters of S are in J as well.

Chef likes to write poetry. Today, he has decided to write a X pages long poetry, but unfortunately his notebook has only Y pages left in it. Thus he decided to buy a new CHEFMATE notebook and went to the stationary shop. Shopkeeper showed him some N notebooks, where the number of pages and price of the ith one are Pi pages and Ci rubles respectively. Chef has spent some money preparing for Ksen's birthday, and then he has only K rubles left for now.

Chef wants to buy a single notebook such that the price of the notebook should not exceed his budget and he is able to complete his poetry.

Help Chef accomplishing this task. You just need to tell him whether he can buy such a notebook or not. Note that Chef can use all of the Y pages in the current notebook, and Chef can buy only one notebook because Chef doesn't want to use many notebooks.",0,0,0,1

**Details:**
Chef has a binary tree. The binary tree consists of 1 or more nodes. Each node has a unique integer id. Each node has up to 2 children, which are identified by their ids, and each node is the child of at most 1 other node. A node X is considered to be an ancestor of node Y if node Y is a child of node X or if there is some node Z for which X is an ancestor of Z and Y is a child of Z. No node is an ancestor of itself. A special node called the root node is an ancestor of all other nodes.

Chef has forgotten which node of his tree is the root, and wants you to help him to figure it out. Unfortunately, Chef's knowledge of the tree is incomplete. He does not remember the ids of the children of each node, but only remembers the sum of the ids of the children of each node.

There are N bags with coins in a row (numbered 1 through N); for each valid i, the i - th bag contains A(i) coins. Chef should make the number of coins in each bag divisible by a given integer K in the following way:

choose an integer c between 0 and N (inclusive)
take some coins from the first c bags ― formally, for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ c), he may choose any number of coins between 0 and A(i) inclusive and take them out of the i-th bag
move some of these coins to some of the last N−c bags ― formally, for each i ( c+1 ≤ i ≤ N), he may place a non-negative number of coins in the i-th bag
The number of coins placed in the last N−c bags must not exceed the number of coins taken out from the first c bags, but there may be some coins left over. Let's denote the number of these coins by RR. You should find the smallest possible value of RR.

Geometry expert Nitin is thinking about a problem with parabolas, icosahedrons, crescents and trapezoids, but for now, to encourage beginners, he chooses to work with circles and rectangles.

You are given two sequences A1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BN. You should choose a permutation P1,P2,…,PN of the integers 1 through N and construct N rectangles with dimensions A1×BP1,A2×BP2,…,AN×BPN. Then, for each of these rectangles, you should construct an inscribed circle, i.e. a circle with the maximum possible area that is completely contained in that rectangle.

Let S be the sum of diameters of these N circles. Your task is to find the maximum value of S.

There are K nuclear reactor chambers labelled from 0 to K-1. Particles are bombarded onto chamber 0. The particles keep collecting in the chamber 0. However if at any time, there are more than N particles in a chamber, a reaction will cause 1 particle to move to the immediate next chamber(if current chamber is 0, then to chamber number 1), and all the particles in the current chamber will be be destroyed and same continues till no chamber has number of particles greater than N. Given K,N and the total number of particles bombarded (A), find the final distribution of particles in the K chambers. Particles are bombarded one at a time. After one particle is bombarded, the set of reactions, as described, take place. After all reactions are over, the next particle is bombarded. If a particle is going out from the last chamber, it has nowhere to go and is lost.

Most problems on CodeChef highlight chef's love for food and cooking but little is known about his love for racing sports. He is an avid Formula 1 fan. He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed.

Formally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long.

Count the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.

In the mysterious country of Byteland, everything is quite different from what you'd normally expect. In most places, if you were approached by two mobsters in a dark alley, they would probably tell you to give them all the money that you have. If you refused, or didn't have any - they might even beat you up.

In Byteland the government decided that even the slightest chance of someone getting injured has to be ruled out. So, they introduced a strict policy. When a mobster approaches you in a dark alley, he asks you for a specific amount of money. You are obliged to show him all the money that you have, but you only need to pay up if he can find a subset of your banknotes whose total value matches his demand. Since banknotes in Byteland can have any positive integer value smaller than one thousand you are quite likely to get off without paying.

Both the citizens and the gangsters of Byteland have very positive feelings about the system. No one ever gets hurt, the gangsters don't lose their jobs, and there are quite a few rules that minimize that probability of getting mugged (the first one is: don't go into dark alleys - and this one is said to work in other places also).

OpenGenus/cosmos,4721,PSA: Plagiarism in Pull Requests,"As many of you have noticed, I have come back to maintain this repository after a few months.

While I am reviewing pull requests, I've been noticing many examples of people (I won't say names) plagiarising code from other sources, such as other algorithms repositories or websites.

Obviously, this behavior is intolerable. Copying other's work is a form of disrespect in my eyes and as we can see in our [contributing guidelines](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos blob master .github CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos blob master .github CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) disrespect to others in this community is unacceptable. As a community built on trust, something like plagiarism makes me lose all trust in you as a contributor. I'm sure we all want this repository of information to grow. 

So all in all: _Please do not plagiarise_. I can't check every website and repository to see if it matches your code, so this will be a system built on honor. If I do see plagiarism, do not expect me to readily merge your pull request (as of now, anything in past is in the past).

The reason I've made this issue is so that it gets a lot of visibility from our contributors (hopefully). 

I would appreciate any comments below as to what action should be taken in order to combat plagiarism.

@OpenGenus cosmos-maintainers @AdiChat @iendeavor I'd like to know your thoughts on this as well. Perhaps we can add a modification to the code of conduct that warns people against copying other's code?",7,5,0,2

 This is an interactive problem. It means that every time you output something, you must finish with a newline character and flush the output. For example, in C++ use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java — call System.out.flush(), in Python — sys.stdout.flush(), and in Pascal — flush(output). Only after flushing the output will you be able to read from the input again.

Little Elephant was fond of inventing new games. After a lot of research, Little Elephant came to know that most of the animals in the forest were showing less interest to play the multi-player games.Little Elephant had started to invent single player games, and succeeded in inventing the new single player game named COIN FLIP.

In this game the player will use N coins numbered from 1 to N, and all the coins will be facing in ""Same direction"" (Either Head or Tail),which will be decided by the player before starting of the game.

The player needs to play N rounds.In the k-th round the player will flip the face of the all coins whose number is less than or equal to k. That is, the face of coin i will be reversed, from Head to Tail, or, from Tail to Head, for i ≤ k.

Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing a particular face after playing N rounds. Elephant really becomes quite fond of this game COIN FLIP, so Elephant plays G times. Please help the Elephant to find out the answer.

After a long and successful day of preparing food for the banquet, it is time to clean up. There is a list of n jobs to do before the kitchen can be closed for the night. These jobs are indexed from 1 to n.

Most of the cooks have already left and only the Chef and his assistant are left to clean up. Thankfully, some of the cooks took care of some of the jobs before they left so only a subset of the n jobs remain. The Chef and his assistant divide up the remaining jobs in the following manner. The Chef takes the unfinished job with least index, the assistant takes the unfinished job with the second least index, the Chef takes the unfinished job with the third least index, etc. That is, if the unfinished jobs were listed in increasing order of their index then the Chef would take every other one starting with the first job in the list and the assistant would take every other one starting with the second job on in the list.

The cooks logged which jobs they finished before they left. Unfortunately, these jobs were not recorded in any particular order. Given an unsorted list of finished jobs, you are to determine which jobs the Chef must complete and which jobs his assitant must complete before closing the kitchen for the evening.

Each Bytelandian gold coin has an integer number written on it. A coin n can be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n 2, n 3 and n 4. But these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit).

You can also sell Bytelandian coins for American dollars. The exchange rate is 1:1. But you can not buy Bytelandian coins.

You have one gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars you can get for it?

Vlad enjoys listening to music. He lives in Sam's Town. A few days ago he had a birthday, so his parents gave him a gift: MP3-player! Vlad was the happiest man in the world! Now he can listen his favorite songs whenever he wants!

Vlad built up his own playlist. The playlist consists of N songs, each has a unique positive integer length. Vlad likes all the songs from his playlist, but there is a song, which he likes more than the others. It's named ""Uncle Johny"".

After creation of the playlist, Vlad decided to sort the songs in increasing order of their lengths. For example, if the lengths of the songs in playlist was {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after sorting it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Before the sorting, ""Uncle Johny"" was on K-th position (1-indexing is assumed for the playlist) in the playlist.

Vlad needs your help! He gives you all the information of his playlist. Your task is to find the position of ""Uncle Johny"" in the sorted playlist.",0,0,0,3

Chef is very fond of horses. He enjoys watching them race. As expected, he has a stable full of horses. He, along with his friends, goes to his stable during the weekends to watch a few of these horses race. Chef wants his friends to enjoy the race and so he wants the race to be close. This can happen only if the horses are comparable on their skill i.e. the difference in their skills is less.

There are N horses in the stable. The skill of the horse i is represented by an integer S[i]. The Chef needs to pick 2 horses for the race such that the difference in their skills is minimum. This way, he would be able to host a very interesting race. Your task is to help him do this and report the minimum difference that is possible between 2 horses in the race.

**Details:**
The most important part of a GSM network is so-called Base Transceiver Station (BTS). These transceivers form the areas called cells (this term gave the name to the cellular phone) and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in a little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically.

The technicians faced a very interesting problem recently. Given a set of BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a long time, one of the programmers found this problem in a conference article. Unfortunately, he found that the problem is so-called ""Traveling Salesman Problem"" and it is very hard to solve. If we have N BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in any order, giving us N! possibilities to examine. The function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product

1.2.3.4....N. The number is very high even for a relatively small N.

The programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But because they have already received the research grant from the government, they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least some results. So they started to study the behavior of the factorial function.

For example, they defined the function Z. For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers N1<N2, then Z(N1) <= Z(N2). It is because we can never ""lose"" any trailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function Z is very interesting, so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently.

PROBLEM : Given a set of n numbers , divide the set in two subsets of n 2 sizes each such that the difference of the sum of two subsets is as minimum as possible

The solution tries every possible subset of half size. We initialize current set as empty and then build it considering that there are two possibilities for each element, either be a part of current set, or be a part of the other subset. We consider both possibilities for every element and when a subset of half size is obtained we check whether this solutions is better than the best solution so far and update as needed

PROBLEM : Given a set of n numbers , divide the set in two subsets of n 2 sizes each such that the difference of the sum of two subsets is as minimum as possible

The solution tries every possible subset of half size.  We initialize current set as empty and then  build it considering that there  are two possibilities for each element, either be a part of current set, or be a  part of the other subset. We consider both possibilities for every element and when a subset of half size is obtained we check whether this solutions is better than the best solution  so far and update as needed

OpenGenus/cosmos,4411,Add code for linear regression with normal equation,"**Fixes issue:**
Fixes #4410 


**Changes:**
* Add python code for linear regression using normal equation.
* The code gives a thorough idea of the implementation
* The comments make it easier to understand
* Note: The scikit-learn linear regression module uses the same mechanism but this is a bare implementation by only using `numpy` as the external library.

# Data Structure Name
MinQueue

## Explanation
This data structure has support for pop, top, push, and is_empty. It has the minimum element be the most significant  
### pop 
Allows the minimum element to be popped 
### top
Returns a reference to the minimum element. 
###  push
adds a new element according the the minimum sorting of elements and puts it in the correct place 
### is_empty()
returns true when empty, false otherwise
### size()
returns amount of elements in the minQueue



## Complexity
### pop 
O(1)
### top
O(1)
###  push
O(n). n being the number of elements in the minQueue at the time.
### is_empty()
O(1)
### size()
O(1)

**Details:**
The current implementation of stack in python doesn't have a generic is_empty() function, but calls the same assert condition in both peek() and pop() function.
Hence, there is no abstracted way of determining if the stack is really empty without peeking, or popping.

**This is a(n):**
<!-- choose one by changing [ ] to [x] -->
- [ ] New algorithm
- [ ] Update to an existing algorithm
- [ ] Error
- [x] Proposal to the Repository

**Details:**
In design pattern, we have two folders with same name but different casing - [OOP_patterns](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos tree master code design_pattern src OOP_patterns) and [oop_patterns](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos tree master code design_pattern src oop_patterns). As a result of this I'm unusual git activity on MacOS; since it has case insensitive filepaths, git treats difference between the contents of folders as committed and new at same time. 

Please refer screenshot, I have removed coupled of lines on purpose to have ++ and -- view at same time.
Operations like reset, checkout files (discard contents), stash, rebase, commit dont work on them.

OpenGenus/cosmos,4098,Added algorithm for Preemptive Scheduling In OS,"**Fixes issue:**
<!-- [Mention the issue number it fixes or add the details of the changes if it doesn't has a specific issue. -->
Actually adds one more new algorithm , for preemptive scheduling in Operating System job scheduling. The code is in c and shows which process will run when , provided we have arrival time, burst time and priority.

- **Preemptive Scheduling** --> Preemptive scheduling is used when a process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state. The resources are allocated to the process for the limited amount of time and then is taken away, and the process is again placed back in the ready queue if that process still has CPU burst time remaining. That process stays in ready queue till it gets next chance to execute. 
- Important algorithm that must be a part.


**Changes:**
<!-- Add here what changes were made in this pull request. -->
- Added folder preemptive_scheduling at cosmos code operating_system src scheduling 
- Added file preemp.c in the above path.

**Changes:** Rewrote code that did not sort properly (see original issue).   Specifically  
selction sort involves finding the min of an array and to keep removing until you have a sorted array
first create a function which traverses the array and does the pair by pair switch
then selection_sort will call that function across  the length of the array.  Assumes a O(n^2) runtime

- [ ] Proposal to the Repository

**Details:**
* The travis build(as of Job #1944.1) is again failing due to errors from the file code sorting src sleep_sort sleep_sort.c
* The code is windows specific. Our build system for travis ci targets only the linux os. That's the cause of error

**Proposals:**
* My suggestion is to port the code for sleep sort to play nicely with linux os. I can update the existing algorithm. Then we can add a documentation on how to run c-programs for testing in local system and specifically mention that the current build doesn't support windows specific code.
* Or add a build system config for windows specific files(might cost some time)

OpenGenus/cosmos,3947,Use autoformatters to enforce style of all programming languages in cosmos.,"<!-- Thanks for filing an issue! Before submitting, please fill in the following information. -->

<!--Required Information-->

**This is a(n):**
<!-- choose one by changing [ ] to [x] -->
- [ ] New algorithm
- [ ] Update to an existing algorithm
- [ ] Error
- [x] Proposal to the Repository

**Details:**

Currently, our repository contains various style guides in [guides coding_style](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos tree master guides coding_style). Enforcing that contributors follow this style guide is very difficult for contributors and maintainers alike. As such, I propose that we add autoformatters for all programming languages being used in cosmos and enforce their usage through Travis CI. This way, fixing code style is a simple matter of running one command. In addition, I believe that formatters that don't allow configuration are better, so that there are no arguments over what style is better; you simply follow whatever the autoformatter does.

I will use this as a tracking issue for all the autoformatters available. I will probably add some of them, but others can also do so (while referencing this issue).

Autoformatters:

- [ ] C++ - clang-format with [Google C++ Style Guide](https:  google.github.io styleguide cppguide.html)
- [x] Python - [Black](https:  github.com ambv black), the uncompromising Python code formatter. (PR: #3949)
- [ ] Java - [google-java-format](https:  github.com google google-java-format) is a Java formatter that does not allow configurability.
- [ ] C - clang-format (with what style guide?)
- [x] Javascript - [Prettier](https:  github.com prettier prettier), an opinionated code formatter. (PR: #3950)
- [ ] Ruby - [Rubocop](https:  github.com rubocop-hq rubocop), which formats based on the community style guide and in addition finds linting errors.
- [ ] C# - Not sure if anything can be done about C#, considering that this is Travis CI, although Travis _does_ support Windows.
- [ ] Go - Gofmt without a doubt.
- [ ] Rust - Rustfmt without a doubt.
- TODO: Add more programming languages.

If anyone would like to discuss more code formatters or other options, please feel free to reply to this issue. If anyone wants to add one in particular to Travis CI, then reference this issue and go for it!

<!-- choose one by changing [ ] to [x] -->
- [x] New algorithm
- [ ] Update to an existing algorithm
- [ ] Error
- [ ] Proposal to the Repository

**Details:**
<!-- Details of algorithm to be added updated -->
A bipartite graph is balanced if it has equal number of nodes on both sides.
A bipartite graph is weighted if each of its edges has an associated value.
In a balanced bipartite graph with 2n nodes, a perfect matching selects n edges so that each left node is matched with one and only one right node, and vice versa.

In a balanced and weighted bipartite graph containing at least one perfect matching, the Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm can find the perfect matching that gives the maximum possible sum of weights.

Note that this algorithm is different from the Hungarian Algorithm, which I believe is already in the  repository: [kuhn_maximum_matching](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos tree master code graph_algorithms src kuhn_maximum_matching) and [maximum_bipartite_matching](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos tree master code graph_algorithms src maximum_bipartite_matching).",0,0,0,0

See [this](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos blob a1580ec20dd10438d07fa6596975eddb42b72ecc makefile#L3), due to this whenever we have a new PR with "".c"" extension it will complile all the "".c"" files. And as there are lot many errors in many "".c""  files that the travis build will always fail. I would request to either correct all the files with errors (which will be very hard and time consuming for a single person), correct make file, or correct travis.yml.

OpenGenus/cosmos,3556,[JS] Use .reduce to get the sum in 'average',"**Fixes issue:**

Avoid using `.map` (creates a new unnecessary array) to sum numbers.

This change uses `.reduce` which is perfectly suited for the case.

**Changes:**

- Removes spurious `.map` (should have been a `.forEach`) and replace it with a more functional-ly `.reduce` to calculate the sum.
- Minor source formatting fixes. Mostly indentation white space.

#3441 
  

**Changes:**
I don't think that issue has necessarily been solved so I'll make a pull-request that has modified the file so that it can print specific insertions, deletions, and print the tree itself.

Explanation of the output implmentation:
For example, it takes in an input_file.txt containing i6 i8 i3 i1 i9 i5 i2 d1 d5 p.
i6 means insert 6, d1 means delete 1, and p means print the nodes. The printing in this case uses the traversal in the original implementation and outputs the nodes and their relations under the ""BST representation"" heading. Example below.

The output of the above test case would be:
root: 6
Insert: 8
8 goes right (parent: 6)
Insert: 3
3 goes left (parent: 6)
Insert: 1
1 goes left (parent: 6)
1 goes left (parent: 3)
Insert: 9
9 goes right (parent: 6)
9 goes right (parent: 8)
Insert: 5
5 goes left (parent: 6)
5 goes right (parent: 3)

OpenGenus/cosmos,3494,add implementations to validate ipv4 and ipv6 in C,"

**Fixes issue:**
#3431 
Added validate IPv6 and IPv4 (2 separate but really similar files) in C


**Changes:**
Implemented two separate but similar files called validate_ipv4.c and validate_ipv6 that validate both types respectively. They both, however, have very similar code with very small minor differences and I can try to do one of them in a completely different way if needed.

OpenGenus/cosmos,3493,spiral_print.c : added two functions for creating the matrix on the heap.,"

**Changes:**
<!-- Add here what changes were made in this pull request. -->
* I added two functions for creating the matrix on the heap. In arbitrary size.   
```c
 *
	Creates a matrix on the heap (uses malloc).
	And initializes the matrix with random numbers. 
* 
int ** createMatrix(int N, int M);

 *
	Destroys the matrix and tidy up. 
* 
void freeMatrix(int N, int M, int ** matrix);
```
* In addition, I changed the parameter type of the functions ```print(...)``` and the function ```printSpiral(...)```. So that I can give it the matrix on the heap.   
* I changed the ```main(...)``` for using my functions above.

OpenGenus/cosmos,3371,File and Folder Names,"**This is a(n):**
- [ ] New algorithm
- [ ] Update to an existing algorithm
- [ ] Error
- [x] Proposal to the Repository

**Details:**

Just wanted to discuss something that's common to Cosmos and Cosmos Search repos. During a search, we basically check if a .cpp etc. file exists in the Cosmos repo folder. 

So during the search, if a query is taken as ""Logistic regression"", all possible uppercase lowercase permutations will have to be generated for a match to be found (e.g Logistic regression, logistic Regression, Logistic Regression, Logistic REgression etc.).

Now if a protocol could be defined that forces all .cpp files and their folders to be named in ONLY lowercase, then this problem would not occur. Then, the query can be converted to lowercase and matched with the database of the files.

If you could allow us to rename the all existing files to lowercase, it could speed up the search!

**Details:**
- Currently, our TravisCI build for C fails because an external library, libgraph-1.0.2, contains numerous errors. Because of this, the build is unable to succeed.
- I propose adding the change to the continuous integration so that this library is ignored, and even if it contains errors, the build should pass. (This makes sense, since a bad build isn't our problem anyways).

i) The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
ii) The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
iii) The left and right subtree must each also be a binary search tree.
iv) There must be no duplicate nodes.
Whenever an element is to be searched, start searching from the root node. Then if the data is less than the key value, search for the element in the left subtree. Otherwise, search for the element in the right subtree.

I went through the readme files of various algorithms in this repo & observed that none of them followed a specific format. Some of them only have a definition & an external link for further reading, for ex., [bogo_sort](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos tree master code sorting src bogo_sort) , while others have a proper explanation, for ex., [bubble_sort](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos tree master code sorting src bubble_sort).
 I think, there must be some specific format for creating readme files of these algorithms. For example, for every algorithm, we must give all it's necessary details: i.e., *explanation, pseudcode & time complexity* , while other details are good to have but optional . In the contribution guides folder, there must be documentation guide as well along with coding style guide.
 Since, our end goal is to provide user an offline interface & reduce search time, following a specific format for documentation will definitely improve usability of this project by external applications.

I don't know where it goes wrong. Is there some test case that I am missing or the format is wrong?

##### Fixes issue:

    - [ ] 2. some *src*s call to stdin stdout that need be removed.
    - [x] 3. how to compile code in the *src* *test*?

- new:

    - [ ] 6. add prerequisites to avoid that re-compile files in each commit.
    - [x] 7. do we need clang?

##### Solutions:
- [ ] issue 1 error message of compiler throws: redefinition multiple main functions.
    * remove main functions in all source codes
    * add file it defined main function to detect that if source codes defined main function.

- [ ] issue 2 some *src*s call to stdin stdout that need be removed.
    * remove stdin stdout contains in sources.
    * if the input output is used of debug then add precondition around the codes (best, if this would be used for tutorial, the output is useful, and since the c++ is compiled language, the efficiency will not be affected at run time).

- [x] issue  3 how to compile code in the *src* *test*? #3180 
    * the files in the src es will only compile and assemble each, but do not link.
    * the files in the test will also link, and compile will include automatically pch file which is stored in test c++ catch_pch.cpp (this means that the coder must use Catch in their testing).

- [x] issue 4 the make not exit with error code even compile error. #3193 
    * change strategy of compilation:
        1. generate make target dependencies recipe by `g++ -MM`
        2. compile files separately.

- [ ] ~~issue 7 add prerequisites to avoid that re-compile files in each commit.~~
    * create a directory that contains object file that will update for each merge (this is really not a good idea, but works).
    * add log file which records file information to determine which file updated (based on md5 or else).

- [x] issue 7 remove clang support. #3204

for the past 4-5 years with the goal of getting people involved in
Open Source projects like this one. The app sends subscribers a random
open issue for them to help ""triage"". For some languages you can also
suggested areas to add documentation.

The initial approach was inspired by seeing the work of the small
core team spending countless hours asking ""what version was
this in"" and ""can you give us an example app"". The idea is to
outsource these small interactions to a huge team of volunteers
and let the core team focus on their work.

I want to add a badge to the README of this project. The idea is to
provide an easy link for people to get started contributing to this
project. A badge indicates the number of people currently subscribed
to help the repo. The color is based off of open issues in the project.

There are many programs here which have very poor quality. Programs that use single character variables, those literally abusing the language syntax to make code shorter(and unreadable) and programs using legacy tools code. In this form, they are unhelpful to anyone. At one point, this repository will become a pile of useless codes, if these codes are not dealt with properly.

1. Really bad code needs to be removed
2. Salvageable code needs to be improved
3. All codes need to follow same guidelines
4. Whatever tools from GitHub marketplace that are applicable here need to be used. Especially those that ensure code quality.

I think it might even be a good idea to pause accepting new codes for a while until the existing are fixed. Then set up strict guidelines and a proper workflow for accepting submissions, and accept only those codes which are good.

Otherwise, all this effort might go in vain.",11,8,0,10

[I noticed some folders use ""-"" or ""_"" to replace a space](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos tree master code). It can be good to have a convention about that and make all folders in the same way, and some folder have a ""algorithms"" word on it, others, not.

Same with algo files, [in this example](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos tree master code cryptography affine_cipher), you can saw :
- affine_cipher
- affine
- Affine

We can use a naming convention like underscore and camelCase, and keep it.

OpenGenus/cosmos,2672,better way to store compression code (binary),"recently, I'm try to add huffman(maybe more other) compression algorithm, I know how to build tree and extract to dictionary, but the store method is stupid:
I implement that change binary code to bitset(C++ library, which can convenient to set bit) and convert it to hex code, but the output file is larger then input file😫.

e.g., 
         0000101100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000(2)
    -> 0b00000000000000(16)

I think it can count '1' bit to store, but I don't know that is it reduce? (maybe I need hard study math...)
         0000101100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    -> 40 11 01 21 560 (lastest number is bit)
or-> 4 1 0 2 56 (always start at bit 0)

I think that given the amount of PRs and new issues that we are getting in this repository, more people need to be added that have write access and can merge PRs. I am not saying that this is _necessary_, but it will be beneficial in merging PRs and closing issues as fast as possible. Otherwise, it might be too much for just one single person to handle.

OpenGenus/cosmos,2528,Add search parameters for GitHub search for Cosmos,"**Objective**: Make GitHub search work well for searching for codes within Cosmos

**Solution**: Add search parameters to codes as a comment
Ideally, the `search parameter` should include the upper classification  directories and the possible searchable problem statement. This must be done for all existing codes at Cosmos. 

This is a simple and yet powerful enhancement can be performed by anyone in parts 👍 

For instance, for the code for `2d line intersection` in `C` at location `code computational_geometry 2d_line_intersection`, the comment should be:

```
    computational geometry | 2D line intersecton | C
    Part of Cosmos by OpenGenus Foundation
```

Take a look at the `C` code: [see](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos blob master code computational_geometry 2d_line_intersection line.c) 
The second comment is to distinguish codes from OpenGenus and is more of a convention. 
Consider [this search results](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=2d+line+intersection) for `2d line intersection` 

For a fixed convention, we must place the search parameter comment at the top of the code

There are three algorithms that overlap, between `code greedy-algorithms` and `code graph-algorithms`. There should be a single directory for each algorithm in `code graph-algorithms` and a symlink to that directory in `code greedy-algorithms`.

- There exists a single directory in `code graph-algorithms` for the algorithm
- There exists a symlink in `code greedy-algorithms` to the algorithm in `code graph-algorithms`
- for each language the algorithm is implemented in currently, there exists one solution in the new directory in this language

added badge to readme

Hopefully, we could add travis build support for all other languages as well. This should provide few main benefits,

1. For now, we can fix issues in existing C programs. Click on the badge in readme and look at the huge list of errors dumped by the compilers(clang and gcc). Contributers --> Fix them.
2. Once this is fixed, no new PR should break the build. We will be able to see beforehand if it does so, and fix it.
3. Maintains quality, and easier for maintainers to maintain the repo.

Do add support for other languages 👍

I was googling up about the header file `<bits stdc++.h>`, and found that it is considered generally bad practice to use it, because it is nonportable (It only works on g++, not MSVC or XCode), and it increases compilation time and runtime (linking all the implementations) (since it is including everything in the standard library).

2. ([Source](https:  stackoverflow.com a 33764128 6525260))

Thus, I vote not using this header file and instead directly including files from the standard.

**Changes:**
So, it turns out someone else did the knight tour in c before i finished it ;_;.
But,  in the end, i didn't use backtracking to solve this problem (it took way too much time) and i used Warnsdorf's rule.
I think this approach is worth being in parrallele to the one existing, but it don't really fit the backtracking folder.

##### Problem statement:
Given a set of n types of 3D rectangular boxes, find the maximum height that can be reached stacking instances of these boxes.

##### Observations:
- A box  can be stacked on top of another box only if the dimensions of the 2D base of the lower box are each strictly larger than those of the 2D base of the higher box.
- The boxes can be rotated so that any side functions as its base.
- It is allowable to use multiple instances of the same type of box.

The task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.

For e.g: 
```
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.

2. If we have a build system, we can build more complex data structures and algorithms on top of simpler ones that have already been implemented in Cosmos.
3. Most modern build systems let code be directly imported from github. This encourages people to use those features instead of exporting the raw files from this repo and not contributing their changes back.

OpenGenus/cosmos,1233,Create reverse_queue.py,"#706 

Reverse Queue created in Python Language.

Actually I do not want to work twice as creating a new Queue class, considering Queue in Python has been created [here](https:  github.com OpenGenus cosmos blob master code data_structures queue queue queue.py). I prefer to import it and give a link to it in my code, like this one #1206

But there are some differences with what I know and what I want, and those will affect my code. Such as:
+ The data entered can only be in integer data type
+ dequeue() method removes the first element and returning its value, which should not.
+ No method for front() and size()
+ Attributes can still be accessed from outside the class

But still, I have some doubt. 
- The size method() returns whether the current queue size or queue's max size.
- I don't know whether I should make the `max` variable to be private or public.

In the end, I make size() for returning the current queue size, and `max` to be private because I didn't use it outside the class.",2,0,0,4

However the project has quickly evolved and the algorithms range has expanded. Due to this finding of algorithms becomes tedious for a user.
To remedy this I have made an online interface for cosmos.
Code - https:  github.com itaditya cosmos-web-interface
Website - https:  cosmos-web.surge.sh algorithm bit-manipulation bit_division

The web interface aims to cater to a larger audience who doesn't necessarily know how to use git github. 

My project is currently in development but the major features are ready. Also I have designed as such that as new algorithms are added to your repo, the web interface can be updated as well with just one command.

It would be awesome if you could mention my project in your README so that more people can discover this tool.

OpenGenus/cosmos,325,"Queue.c: Fixes several GCC warnings, typos and style issues.","Good evening.

I checked the code for the Queue implementation in C and it had a lot of GCC warnings when compiling, as well as some obvious C bad practices (no specified return type for functions, was missing an include for <stdlib.h>, etc.) apart from a minor typo on the actual program.

This commit attempts to fix those issues in order to provide a better example (imho) to learners; I've however maintained the original algorithm implementation (since I didn't write this) and the program runs exactly the same.

There could be some arguments made about replacing scanf calls with fgets (for security purposes) and some other changes but I've decided to not work on this further as to adhere to the KISS principle.

Anyways this is my first pull request in years so I hope I have done everything right; I'm not sure if I'm allowed to work on other people's implementations but I sent the PR regardless.
