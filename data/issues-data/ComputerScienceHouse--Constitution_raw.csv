ComputerScienceHouse/Constitution,198,Remove spending committees,"Check one:
- [x] Semantic Change: something about the meaning of the text is different
- [ ] Non-semantic Change: Spelling, grammar, or formatting changes.

This PR attempts to address a few things. First and most importantly, the notion of a spending committee is unnecessary bureaucracy that we should trim from the spending process.

## Delete spending committees

Currently, the process is for spending money from a directorship's budget is (roughly) the following:
1. Get permission from the directorship who's budget the purchase will fall under
2. Get approval from financials to spend the money
3. Request approval from RIT (Currently res life, subject to change)
3b. Wait probably a few days to get approval from RIT (I have a lot of complaints about this part but this is a PR not a discourse post)
4. If the purchase is between $100-$300, convince 1 4 of quorum (Currently ~10 ish active voting members, which is tough to come by pre-ten weeks) to gather somewhere and say whether or not you're allowed to use your budget
5. Pick up the pro card from RIT during business hours, or if it's an online purchase hope that you can buy said thing from an RIT approved vendor, otherwise more bureaucracy incoming
6. Actually go spend money on some purchase
7. Return the pro card and any relevant receipts to RIT by 2pm the following day (If online purchase, skip this step)

Removing the spending committee would delete step 4 from the process. My argument is that there are already several layers of approval already baked into the process of spending CSH funds and that a spending committee does not accomplish it's goal of preventing directorships for making purchases that they should not be making, and instead is just a big waste of time.

It's also been particularly difficult when attempting to plan events whose cost scales with the number of attendees when we get one number on an interest form and then right before the event a ton of people sign up. It's tough to know which events we'd need to do comittees for and which we wouldn't, and we're discouraged from simply always holding spending committees because of the hassle of organizing them. A point to the contrary is that we could make sign up forms for every event with a deadline and say that anyone who doesn't sign up by the deadline will have to pay for themselves. While there is definitely merit in this idea, it would likely have the direct result of reducing attendance which is something we generally try to avoid as much as possible.

## Define ""single expenditures""

Second, I added a definition to what a `single expenditure` is, as previously we only had a definition for what a group expenditure is. Definitely open to modifying that definition, it just seemed non-obvious to determine what a single expenditure is based on the definition provided.

## Change the $300 limit to a percentage of a directorship's budget
Third, I changed the value of what the single group expenditures to sort of fill in the gaps of where the spending committee left off. Rather than having a fixed value for the distinction between purchases, I opted to include a percentage of the directorship's' budget. Also, I'm totally down to change the exact values, this post is mostly for discussion so I didn't think too hard about the exact numbers.

Pros of this change:
* The amount directorships can spend will change from year to year based on our overall budget
  * While there are some fixed purchases, the vast majority of the purchases we make demonstrate a positive correlation between price and the number of active members. Opcomm will have to buy less hard drives if there's less members making minecraft servers, socials will have to spend less money on welcome back if there's less people eating burgers, etc
* Larger directorships will have higher limits than smaller directorships
  * If smaller budgets like PR are spending more than $40, we probably should know about it. On the other hand, it's hard for socials to make a purchase without spending over $40, and they probably shouldn't have to ask house every time they want to spend money
* While at the end of the day it's still an arbitrary percentage, saying ""don't spend more than 10% of your budget in one go"" has a pretty clear rationality behind it as opposed to saying ""don't spend above the magic number $100 or else,"" which can be frustrating to members

Cons of this change:
* I'm biased
  * The socials budget is the largest budget, and these changes would make it easier for larger budgets and potentially more restrictive for smaller budgets
* The amount directorships can spend will change from year to year based on our overall budget
  * I definitely think this is more a pro than a con, but there are definitely some fixed costs that we have. Our app store license is always $100 a year regardless of how many members we have(idk if we even pay for that anymore but you get the idea)
  * ""Active"" members who participate a bunch in csh does not always equal active members who pay dues.
    * The proportion of active alumni to active members can sometimes fluctuate pretty heavily, so having a percentaged based off of the total budget (which consists solely of dues afaik) might not be the best metric
* Directorships would need to be aware of their individual limits and would not just be able to determine if they need a vote on something if it's >$300

tl;dr is spending committees mostly just hinder members trying to do the right thing and in reality don't do anything to prevent directorships from abusing the system if they're so inclined, so we should just get rid of it. Also, having a fixed value be the distinction between needing to vote on a purchase or not sorta sucks and should be replaced with a percentage. ",0,0,0,3

Minor Project is a very small project that becomes a part of the ten weeks process. It is handled similarly to a major project, but with significantly smaller expectations. It aims to add a measure of passion and ability to learn to the intro process. Instead of successfully participating in Freshman Project, Introductory members will be expected to pass a minor project for their Introductory Evaluation.

Summary of change(s):
Scale the permanent directorship meeting requirement based on how many semesters a member is active for. This moves the requirement in line (more or less) with the requirement for introductory members (one per week).

Things to note:
* I made the requirement fifteen per semester rather than one per week for a few reasons. The primary reason is that scaling it per week seems too fine-grained to me, and requires considerable extra bookkeeping. Scaling by week also makes the requirements per semester 14, which isn't quite as round a number as I'd like. It also made the wording slightly more cumbersome.
* I'm not convinced the wording of my change is ideal, so I'd welcome feedback on how to improve that. In particular, I want to make sure it doesn't read as requiring meeting attendance to actually be distributed to 15 per semester - just a total of 30 for the whole year, if you're active both semesters.",0,0,0,13

Summary of change(s):


Exactly when house wide discussions of semantic changes should be held is currently vague and unclear.  Currently, we have discussion on amendments one week after their proposal.  The current wording could easily be interpreted as meaning otherwise.  This change would require proposed amendments to be discussed immediately after being proposed, rather than one week later.  This change would prevent members from voting no on an amendment simply because they don't like the wording of the amendment as they would have been able to discuss their issues involving wording and phrasing one week prior to voting.  
As is, the constitution says that after an amendment's discussion, the amendment creator will have one week to edit and re work the amendment.  Currently, there is absolutely no time for a change to be made to amendment following it's house wide discussion.",2,2,0,4

Summary of change(s):

Moves the amendment discussion from House Meeting to History Discussion instead. It's a more appropriate place to talk about amendments, does not bloat House Meeting unnecessarily, and still leaves the overall process in-tact.  

---

Interestingly, we have also mis-interpreted the constitution this whole time and discussion *is* supposed to take place when an amendment is proposed so that changes can be made ahead of time to the vote (instead of just voting no if you don't like the wording). This amendment would reinforce that this discussion take place at a History Discussion instead and that simply a summary of the discussion would be presented to House.

I still think discussion is key to making quality and useful amendments, I just feel that House Meeting is no longer the best place for them given the quantity and length of discussion needed the past two semesters. History Discussions are well suited specifically for talking about large issues that face House and will allow members who feel passionately about an issue to debate and present findings to House at large.

The timeline for an amendment would look like this:

1. A member creates a GitHub pull request for an amendment and notifies the History Director.
2. The amendment will be discussed at the next available History Discussion meeting.
3. The member can either take feedback from the meeting to make appropriate changes leave as is before presenting to House, or they can decide to cancel the amendment altogether if discussion recommends that.
4. At the following house meeting, the amendment is posted to House along with a summary of the discussion leading up to the amendment. *Ballots are handed out now*.
5. Normal ballot voting proceeds, and then the amendment either passes or fails.

Summary of issue:
Reading over the terms of membership and eboard, seems there are two weird inconsistencies.
https:  github.com ComputerScienceHouse Constitution blob master articles.tex#L512

> The term of an officer will be abbreviated due to resignation, impeachment, failure of the evaluation process, or change in membership status.

Does failing Spring Evals end the term of the officer? Current practice has been that they keep the position until the end of the year, regardless of Spring Evals. 
Then there is a contradiction here, I think. 
https:  github.com ComputerScienceHouse Constitution blob master articles.tex#L200

> Active Membership shall last until the member: resigns, fails the Evaluation Process, or changes membership status.

Contradicts here:

https:  github.com ComputerScienceHouse Constitution blob master bylaws.tex#L296

> If the member has previously passed an Membership Evaluation they will move to Alumni Membership status at the end of the Standard Operating Session (\ref{Alumni Membership Selection}).

Your active membership term ends if you ""fail the Evaluation Process."" But, you move to Alumni Membership at the end of the semester. So, do you still get to vote?

Also, we don't define anywhere that an alum in good standing can just pay dues and become an active member again. We actually never define what an alum in good standing is. We only say how you become one.

ComputerScienceHouse/Constitution,7,Advisory membership process appears to just be weird.,"In the bylaws this section pops up.
d. Ballots will then be distributed for a secret ballot, fifty-percent House vote, as defined in 5.C.2. If more than two advisors are selected via this process, the Executive Board may call for a revote amongst the candidates selected in order to reduce the number of advisors to a workable level. If this decision is made, the candidates selected in the first ballot become the nominees for the second ballot and Step Three and Four are repeated. This recast process may not be repeated a second time.

This section is ""numbered"" by letter and references a three and four, which do not exist. 

Also, it should probably be changed to say ""as defined in the Constitution in 5.C.2"" as that is talked about in the constitution not in the bylaws. Also, if you wanted to shorten that, you could define something like B.5.C.2 as bylaws section 5.C.2 and C.5.C.2 as constitution section 5.C.2. Just a thought.

Why these changes? YoungMoney and I, current voting members of Eboard, want to start an ad-hoc Web committee to standardize things, coordinate projects, etc. Strictly following the constitution, we are currently unable to do so.

A side effect of the current wording is that we can have multiple secretaries, or a voting Eboard member can also be secretary. I don't really see a problem with this.
