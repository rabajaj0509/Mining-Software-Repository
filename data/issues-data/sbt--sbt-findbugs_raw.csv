When I try to put

> findbugsReportType := Some(FindbugsReportType.FancyHtml)

in `build.sbt`

Instead it...

Complains ""Cannot resolve symbol FindbugsReportType""

Solution

Show full working examples of what settings should look like in the build.sbt file instead of **PARTIAL** examples that are ambiguous

There seems to be a trend with everything SBT related to give ambiguous and incomplete information devoid of clear working examples.

sbt/sbt-findbugs,25,Can't generate HTML output.,"### Expected vs Actual Behaviour

It should generate HTML output for a report.

Instead it crashes.

Generating the XML works fine though and I can render the XML to HTML with the standalone `findbugs` binary.

### Steps to Reproduce

Configuration is

`addSbtPlugin(""com.github.sbt"" % ""sbt-findbugs"" % ""2.0.0"")` in `project plugins.sbt`, `findbugsReportType := Some(FindbugsReport.Html)` in `build.sbt`.

Then output is as follows (same for the other report types apart from the XML one):

```

sbt/sbt-findbugs,4,"Customise findbugs rules for Scala -- reduce false positives, add scala specific rules","Is there any work underway to customise the findbugs rules for Scala?

I've installed `findbugs4sbt` but the core findbugs rules produce lots of false positives around class & method naming conventions that are caused by Scala.

I can't be the first person to notice this -- surely all other users of findbugs4sbt must have the same problems?

Is there a project that has a ruleset for findbugs which is customised to work well with Scala? (Both by removing fixing rules which give false positives in Scala and also by adding new Scala specific rules.)

If so, I would think that we should add it to the README, as it seems likely to be a FAQ.

If not, perhaps we should start one? Would that be considered out of scope for `findbugs4sbt` itself?

sbt/sbt-findbugs,3,Include findbugs-contrib rules,"While findbugs code has a good base set of rules, most of Findbug's bug patterns are defined in `findbugs-contrib`.

If so, we should probably add it by default (or at least add easy to follow instructions to the docs on how to include).

```
Some(crossTarget   ""findbugs""   ""report.xml""

which seems syntactically incorrect (there is no closing parenthesis) and doesn't seem to match the actual location, which is:

```
